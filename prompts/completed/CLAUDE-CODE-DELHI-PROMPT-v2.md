# FORTHEPEOPLE.IN — ADD DELHI (NCT) — CLAUDE CODE PROMPT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Paste this ENTIRE prompt into Claude Code.
# ⚠️  DO NOT DEPLOY. Everything runs LOCAL ONLY until I verify.
# ⚠️  Only New Delhi district will be active. Other 10 = inactive.
# ⚠️  A one-command activation script is created for later use.
# Estimated: 1 Claude Code session
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE

Read this entire file. Execute ALL steps in order. After every major step,
log what you did. At the end, start the local dev server so I can test.

**IMPORTANT — DO NOT:**
- Run `git push` or deploy to Vercel
- Run `npx vercel --prod` or any deployment command
- Modify any existing Karnataka district data
- Delete or alter any existing seed data

**IMPORTANT — DO:**
- Run everything against the LOCAL Prisma dev proxy (not production Neon)
- Test by visiting http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi
- Verify all 29 modules render (even if some show "No data available" — that's fine)
- Create an activation script for the other 10 Delhi districts for later use

## STEP 2: UPDATE STATIC CONSTANTS

**File: src/lib/constants/districts.ts**

Find the existing Delhi entry in the Union Territories section. REPLACE it with:

```typescript
{
  slug: "delhi", name: "Delhi", nameLocal: "दिल्ली",
  active: true, capital: "New Delhi", type: "ut",
  districts: [
    { name: "New Delhi", slug: "new-delhi", active: true },
    { name: "Central Delhi", slug: "central-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "North Delhi", slug: "north-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "North West Delhi", slug: "north-west-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "North East Delhi", slug: "north-east-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "East Delhi", slug: "east-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "South Delhi", slug: "south-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "South West Delhi", slug: "south-west-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "South East Delhi", slug: "south-east-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "West Delhi", slug: "west-delhi", active: false },
    { name: "Shahdara", slug: "shahdara", active: false },
  ],
},
```

---

## STEP 3: ADD WEATHER & CROP OVERRIDES

### File: src/scraper/jobs/weather.ts
Add ALL 11 Delhi district slugs to OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE, all mapping to 'New Delhi':
```typescript
'new-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'central-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'north-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'north-west-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'north-east-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'east-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'south-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'south-west-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'south-east-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'west-delhi': 'New Delhi',
'shahdara': 'New Delhi',
```

### File: src/scraper/jobs/crops.ts
Add ALL 11 to AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE, all mapping to 'Delhi':
```typescript
'new-delhi': 'Delhi',
'central-delhi': 'Delhi',
'north-delhi': 'Delhi',
'north-west-delhi': 'Delhi',
'north-east-delhi': 'Delhi',
'east-delhi': 'Delhi',
'south-delhi': 'Delhi',
'south-west-delhi': 'Delhi',
'south-east-delhi': 'Delhi',
'west-delhi': 'Delhi',
'shahdara': 'Delhi',
```

---

## STEP 4: CREATE NEW DELHI SEED FILE

**File: prisma/seed-delhi-data.ts**

This is the MAIN seed file. Seeds comprehensive data for **New Delhi district only**.
Follow the EXACT same structure as prisma/seed-bengaluru-data.ts.

### File template:
```typescript
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ForThePeople.in — Delhi (NCT) Data Seed — New Delhi District
// Your District. Your Data. Your Right.
// © 2026 Jayanth M B. MIT License with Attribution.
// https://github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople
//
// Run: npx tsx prisma/seed-delhi-data.ts
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
import { PrismaClient } from '../src/generated/prisma';
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg';
import 'dotenv/config';

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL! });
const client = new PrismaClient({ adapter });

async function main() {
  console.log('🏛️  Seeding New Delhi district data...\n');

  const delhi = await client.state.findUnique({ where: { slug: 'delhi' } });
  if (!delhi) throw new Error('Delhi state not found. Run seed-hierarchy.ts first.');

  const district = await client.district.findFirst({
    where: { slug: 'new-delhi', stateId: delhi.id },
  });
  if (!district) throw new Error('New Delhi district not found. Run seed-hierarchy.ts first.');

  const did = district.id;
  console.log(`✓ Found New Delhi (id: ${did})\n`);

  // ... seed all data categories below, checking count before each
}

main()
  .catch((e) => { console.error('❌ Seed error:', e); process.exit(1); })
  .finally(() => client.$disconnect());
```

## STEP 5: CREATE ACTIVATION SCRIPT FOR REMAINING 10 DISTRICTS

**File: scripts/activate-delhi-districts.ts**

This script will be run LATER (not now) when I'm ready to go live with all Delhi districts.

```typescript
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ForThePeople.in — Activate Remaining Delhi Districts
// Run this ONLY after verifying New Delhi works perfectly.
//
// Usage: npx tsx scripts/activate-delhi-districts.ts
//
// What this does:
//   1. Sets active=true for all 10 inactive Delhi districts in DB
//   2. Logs which districts were activated
//   3. Does NOT touch New Delhi (already active)
//   4. Does NOT touch any Karnataka districts
//
// After running:
//   - Update src/lib/constants/districts.ts → set all Delhi districts active: true
//   - Update BLUEPRINT-UNIFIED.md and FORTHEPEOPLE-SKILL-UPDATED.md
//   - git commit + git push to deploy
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
import { PrismaClient } from '../src/generated/prisma';
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg';
import 'dotenv/config';

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL! });
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });

const DELHI_INACTIVE_SLUGS = [
  'central-delhi',
  'north-delhi',
  'north-west-delhi',
  'north-east-delhi',
  'east-delhi',
  'south-delhi',
  'south-west-delhi',
  'south-east-delhi',
  'west-delhi',
  'shahdara',
];

async function main() {
  console.log('🔓 Activating remaining Delhi districts...\n');

  const delhi = await prisma.state.findUnique({ where: { slug: 'delhi' } });
  if (!delhi) throw new Error('Delhi not found in DB. Run seed-hierarchy.ts first.');

  let activated = 0;

  for (const slug of DELHI_INACTIVE_SLUGS) {
    const district = await prisma.district.findFirst({
      where: { slug, stateId: delhi.id },
    });

    if (!district) {
      console.log(`  ⚠️  ${slug} — not found in DB, skipping`);
      continue;
    }

    if (district.active) {
      console.log(`  ✓ ${district.name} — already active`);
      continue;
    }

    await prisma.district.update({
      where: { id: district.id },
      data: { active: true },
    });

    console.log(`  ✅ ${district.name} — ACTIVATED`);
    activated++;
  }

  console.log(`\n🎉 Done! Activated ${activated} districts.`);
  console.log('\n📋 NEXT STEPS:');
  console.log('  1. Edit src/lib/constants/districts.ts → set all Delhi districts active: true');
  console.log('  2. Update BLUEPRINT-UNIFIED.md (pilot districts count)');
  console.log('  3. Update FORTHEPEOPLE-SKILL-UPDATED.md (pilot districts count)');
  console.log('  4. Update README.md (currently live section)');
  console.log('  5. git add -A && git commit -m "feat: activate all 11 Delhi districts"');
  console.log('  6. git push origin main  ← THIS deploys to Vercel');
}

main()
  .catch((e) => { console.error('❌ Error:', e); process.exit(1); })
  .finally(() => prisma.$disconnect());
```

Also create a companion script to seed LIGHT data for the other 10 districts:

**File: scripts/seed-delhi-other-districts.ts**

This seeds minimal data (leadership tiers 4-5, 3-5 police stations, 5 schools,
3 offices, demographics) for the 10 inactive districts. Run this BEFORE running
activate-delhi-districts.ts.

Follow the same Prisma adapter pattern. Check existing count before seeding.
Use real data — search for each district's DM, DCP, police stations, schools.

---

## STEP 6: UPDATE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION (but DO NOT deploy)

### A. Update BLUEPRINT-UNIFIED.md
Under "Current Pilot Scores" add:
```
Delhi (New Delhi):  [pending — run health score calculation after testing]
```

Update the scaling section to mention Delhi as a pending expansion.

### B. Update FORTHEPEOPLE-SKILL-UPDATED.md
Update CURRENT STATE:
```
PILOT DISTRICTS:  4 active (Mandya, Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban — Karnataka; New Delhi — Delhi)
                  + 10 Delhi districts ready to activate
```

### C. Update SCALING-CHECKLIST.md
Add at the bottom under a new section:
```
## DELHI EXPANSION STATUS (April 2026)
- [x] State hierarchy seeded (Delhi UT + 11 districts + subdivisions)
- [x] Static constants updated
- [x] Weather/crop overrides configured
- [x] New Delhi district: full data seeded
- [x] Activation script created (scripts/activate-delhi-districts.ts)
- [x] Other 10 districts: light data seeded (scripts/seed-delhi-other-districts.ts)
- [ ] Local testing verified
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Remaining 10 districts activated
```

### D. Update README.md
Change currently live line to:
```
**Currently live:** Mandya, Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban (Karnataka) + New Delhi (Delhi)
```

### E. DO NOT run git push — just stage the changes:
```bash
git add -A
git status  # Show me what files changed — DO NOT COMMIT YET
```

## STEP 7: LOCAL TESTING CHECKLIST

After all seeding is done, run these commands and verify:

```bash
# Make sure Prisma dev proxy is running in Terminal 1:
# npx prisma dev

# Terminal 2 — regenerate client + seed:
npx prisma generate
npx tsx prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts
npx tsx prisma/seed-delhi-data.ts
npm run dev
```

Then open browser and verify each of these URLs works:

```
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi                    ← Overview page
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/leadership         ← 10-tier hierarchy
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/finance             ← Budget data
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/infrastructure      ← Projects tracker
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/schools             ← School list
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/police              ← Police stations
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/schemes             ← Government schemes
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/elections            ← Election results
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/courts              ← Court stats
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/rti                 ← RTI templates
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/offices             ← Government offices
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/transport           ← Bus + train
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/famous              ← Famous personalities
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/industries          ← Local industries
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/news                ← News (may be empty until scraper runs)
http://localhost:3000/en/delhi/new-delhi/services            ← Service guides
```

Also verify existing districts still work:
```
http://localhost:3000/en/karnataka/mandya                   ← Must still work
http://localhost:3000/en/karnataka/mysuru                   ← Must still work
http://localhost:3000/en/karnataka/bengaluru-urban           ← Must still work
```

Verify the homepage shows Delhi/New Delhi in the drill-down map and district cards:
```
http://localhost:3000                                        ← Homepage
```

**Report what you see on each page.** If anything is broken, fix it before proceeding.

## DELHI-SPECIFIC NOTES (for reference during seeding)

```
1. NDMC vs MCD:
   New Delhi district → NDMC (New Delhi Municipal Council) — separate body
   All other 10 districts → MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi, unified 2022)

2. Police:
   Delhi Police → under MHA (Central Government), NOT Delhi government
   Single Commissioner of Police for all Delhi
   Districts have DCPs, not SPs

3. No rural anything:
   No Gram Panchayats, no MGNREGA (negligible), no JJM
   All districts are 100% urban

4. Land control:
   DDA (Delhi Development Authority) — Central body, controls most land
   Delhi government has limited land authority

5. Power distribution (privatized):
   BSES Rajdhani (Reliance), BSES Yamuna (Reliance), Tata Power DDL
   Delhi government provides subsidy (free up to 200 units)
   PowerOutage records → reference discoms, not state board

6. Health score type:
   All Delhi districts = "metro" type (population density extremely high)
   Weights auto-adjust via getAdjustedWeights() in health-score.ts

7. Hindi font:
   Noto Sans Devanagari — already loaded in globals.css for Kannada nameLocal
   No new font import needed
```

## AFTER LOCAL TESTING IS COMPLETE

When I'm satisfied everything works locally, I will manually run:

```bash
# Step 1: Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add Delhi (NCT) — New Delhi district with full data

- Added Delhi UT hierarchy: 11 revenue districts + subdivisions
- New Delhi district: full data (leadership, budget, infra, schools, police, schemes, elections, courts, RTI, offices, transport, industries, famous)
- Only New Delhi active; other 10 districts ready with activation script
- Weather/crop overrides for all 11 Delhi slugs
- scripts/activate-delhi-districts.ts for one-command future activation"

# Step 2: Deploy
git push origin main

# Step 3 (LATER — when ready for all 11):
npx tsx scripts/seed-delhi-other-districts.ts
npx tsx scripts/activate-delhi-districts.ts
# Then update constants file, commit, push again
```

## END OF PROMPT
