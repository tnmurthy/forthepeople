# FORTHEPEOPLE.IN — UNIFIED MASTER BLUEPRINT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — Combines original + all addendums
# Claude Code: Read this file at the start of EVERY session.
# Generic for ANY Indian district. Pilots: Mandya, Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban (Karnataka).
# Last updated: April 14, 2026
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# 2026-04-14 — Security/perf hardening (responsible disclosure):
#   • /api/payment/contributors anonymized (DPDP): displayName (first + last initial),
#     tierLabel (range, not exact ₹), timeAgo bucket, message truncated to 100 chars.
#     Removed amountRupees and exact paidAt from public response. Cache key bumped to v2.
#     Admin endpoint (/api/admin/payments) unchanged — still returns full data.
#   • SupportCheckout.tsx: Razorpay script loader now de-dupes via DOM query (kills
#     1,200+/session tracking loop). Replaced `new QueryClient()` bug with useQueryClient()
#     (try/catch fallback when rendered outside QueryClientProvider).
#   • robots.ts: removed /admin/ from disallow list — reduces attack-surface signaling.
#
# 2026-04-14 — Mumbai routing + public UpdateLog feed + data fixes:
#   • Routing: slug aliases added (budget→finance, famous→famous-personalities,
#     citizen→citizen-corner, panchayat→gram-panchayat, farm-advisory→farm).
#     Static pages now take precedence over [taluk] catch-all, killing the
#     "Loading taluk…" bug on external/bookmarked links. Each alias uses
#     permanentRedirect so search engines collapse to canonical slug.
#   • UpdateLog extended: +recordCount Int?, +details Json? (existing oldValue/
#     newValue diff kept; new fields serve bulk scraper summaries). Run
#     `npx prisma db push` to apply. logUpdate() helper takes the new params.
#   • Scraper integration: weather/crops/news jobs now call logUpdate() after
#     each successful run (source="scraper", moduleName=module, recordCount=N).
#   • Public transparency surface: GET /api/data/update-log?district=…&filter=
#     (all|scrapers|admin|seeds) with cursor pagination; new module page at
#     /[locale]/[state]/[district]/update-log showing timeline, module/source
#     badges, relative timestamps, filter tabs, load more. Added to LOCAL INFO
#     section of desktop + mobile sidebars. New SIDEBAR_MODULES entry with
#     History icon.
#   • Mumbai fixes:
#     – Courts: avgDays is Float? in schema but treated as number in UI, causing
#       Couldn't load Courts via ErrorBoundary when any row had null. Interface
#       now `number | null`; reduce / toFixed sites guarded.
#     – Taluk count: Overview hero + StatCard now prefer DB count
#       (overview.taluks.length) over hardcoded talukCount in districts.ts so
#       Overview and Map agree.
#     – Population: /api/data/population filters out rows whose source contains
#       "Metropolitan Region" (MMR estimate was 21M for Mumbai district = wrong).
#       Seed-mumbai-data.ts row removed too.
#     – RTI fee ₹₹10: file-rti UI strips leading ₹/Rs prefix before prepending ₹.
#     – Services page gained DataSourceBanner; state-config registers sources
#       for services and update-log.
#   • Post-deploy: aliases moved to next.config.ts redirects() as true 308s
#     (server-component permanentRedirect streamed a 200 with target HTML,
#     which is fine for humans but not for SEO). 5 redirect page.tsx stubs
#     deleted.
#
# 2026-04-14 — Phase 2: Mumbai taluka data + urban-aware UI + classifier tuning:
#   • scripts/fix-mumbai-taluk-names.ts: Mumbai's 13 DB taluks had Kannada
#     nameLocal on some rows and 0 population across the board. Script
#     overwrites nameLocal with Marathi (Devanagari), seeds approximate
#     BMC-ward-aggregate populations + areas, and writes a UpdateLog entry
#     (module=map, action=update, recordCount=13). Data source noted in the
#     script header: BMC ward-wise estimates, exact ward census unavailable.
#   • scripts/backfill-mumbai-update-log.ts: idempotent backdated seed log
#     (15 module entries timestamped ~2026-04-01) so the public /update-log
#     page shows real historical provenance from the moment it ships.
#   • [taluk]/page.tsx: now state-config aware —
#       – subDistrictUnit label (Taluk/Mandal/Ward) instead of hardcoded "Taluk"
#       – removes the hardcoded Kannada "ತಾಲ್ಲೂಕು" suffix after nameLocal
#       – hides Gram Panchayats + JJM module cards when
#         gramPanchayatApplicable/jjmApplicable=false
#       – suppresses the entire "Villages (0)" section for urban districts
#       – stats grid now shows taluk.population (DB seeded value) and a new
#         Area km² card when area is set
#   • /map taluk list now surfaces population + area for urban districts
#     (the 5-shape GeoJSON covers only zone-level boundaries; card grid
#     carries the missing 8 zones via DB data).
#   • alerts/page.tsx: type pills + inline badges now pass through
#     formatTypeLabel() → "water_supply" renders as "Water Supply".
#   • scraper/jobs/news.ts: transport MODULE_KEYWORDS promoted above crops +
#     police in the match order so named-train / commuter / overcrowding
#     headlines win before falling to incidental "agri"/"crime" matches.
#     Added: vande bharat, shatabdi, rajdhani, duronto, tejas, jan shatabdi,
#     local train, mumbai local, suburban, wr local, cr local, best bus,
#     monorail, metro line, commuter(s), overcrowding/overcrowded,
#     stampede at station, train, platform, station, irctc.
#     Crops keyword list unchanged.
#
# 2026-04-14 — Exams: news-driven sync + daily status cron + milestone UI:
#   • GovernmentExam schema extended additively with shortName, organizingBody,
#     category, scope (NATIONAL|STATE), notificationDate, sourceUrls (Json),
#     lastVerifiedAt, needsVerification. Legacy fields (title/department/status
#     lowercase) preserved; new news-sourced rows use UPPERCASE status enum.
#   • src/lib/exam-sync.ts:
#       – extractExamFromNews(article): free-tier AI extraction (no guessing,
#         null for unmentioned fields). Returns null when the article is not
#         about a specific exam.
#       – syncExamFromNews(extraction, article, sourceDistrictId): fuzzy upsert
#         by shortName / title-prefix. NATIONAL scope fans out to every active
#         district; STATE scope to that state's districts. Status never
#         downgrades. null values never overwrite concrete data. sourceUrls
#         array capped at 10. Logs UpdateLog + busts Redis cache per district.
#   • news-action-engine exams case rewired to call the new sync pipeline
#     (replaces the crude direct create).
#   • /api/cron/update-exams (route.ts, Bearer CRON_SECRET, 30 6 * * *):
#       pass A — advance status from calendar dates (APPLICATIONS_OPEN when
#         start<=now<=end, ADMIT_CARD_OUT when admitCardDate<=now, etc.),
#         never downgrading.
#       pass B — set needsVerification=true on non-completed exams whose
#         lastVerifiedAt is older than 30 days.
#     Added to vercel.json crons list.
#   • ExamStepper refactored: no padlocks. Date-driven states —
#       ✅ green + formatted date for past milestones
#       ● blue + date + "in N days" for upcoming
#       · grey "TBA" when the date isn't known
#     Connectors colored by status. Apply button lives under Applications step
#     only when applications are still open.
#   • Exams page:
#       – STATUS_CONFIG now covers both legacy lowercase and new uppercase
#         enum values.
#       – examBucket() groups by new statuses into open/upcoming/closed.
#       – Apply Now button shows whenever applyUrl exists and the exam isn't
#         in a closed bucket (was: only when status="open").
#       – Card footer: "Last updated from news: {relative}" + Source link to
#         the first article in sourceUrls.
#       – "⚠ Unverified" amber pill when needsVerification=true.
#   • src/lib/exam-onboard.ts: onboardDistrictExams(districtId) clones every
#     NATIONAL exam from other active districts + STATE exams matching the
#     target's state. Dedupes by shortName/title; skips rows that already
#     exist at the target. Logs a single UpdateLog summary row.
#   • scripts/backfill-exams-from-news.ts: --limit (default 10, hard-capped at
#     50) + --dry-run. Keyword + title-prefix dedupe, free-tier AI. One bad
#     article never aborts the run.
#
# 2026-04-14 — Phase 2 cont'd: Mumbai map fallback + overview empty sections:
#   • /map: DistrictMapArea replaces MapWithFallback. Fetches the GeoJSON
#     (not HEAD), counts features, compares to DB taluk count. Three states:
#     full (features ≥ taluks → render TalukMap D3), partial (features <
#     taluks → render card grid with coverage notice), missing (render card
#     grid with "boundary data being prepared"). Card grid shows name,
#     nameLocal, population, area per taluk. No more blank map area for
#     Mumbai (5 zone shapes + 13 DB taluks).
#   • Map section label switches to "Urban Zones" for urban districts
#     (showVillages=false); StatCard grid swaps the Villages card for Zones
#     count. The secondary rural village list is only rendered when
#     villages apply.
#   • OverviewClient: Finance & Budget, Police & Public Safety, and Local
#     News sections are now wrapped in {(loading || count > 0) && (…)} so
#     empty modules contribute zero DOM. Inner "No X data available"
#     fallbacks removed (they were unreachable after the outer guard).
#     Resolves massive blank whitespace between the Health Score card and
#     later sections when a module has no rows.

### VERIFIED vs SPECULATIVE

```
VERIFIED (code confirmed):
  - Next.js 16.1.7, React 19, Tailwind v4 CSS-based config
  - Prisma 7.5.0 with @prisma/adapter-pg
  - @upstash/redis (NOT ioredis) on Vercel serverless
  - react-simple-maps for India map + taluk map
  - recharts (lazy loaded with next/dynamic)
  - Razorpay Live keys configured
  - next-intl v4 for English + Kannada
  - @anthropic-ai/sdk for Claude Opus
  - @google/generative-ai for Gemini
  - AES-256-CBC encryption for stored API keys + TOTP secrets

SPECULATIVE (assumed from dependencies, not fully verified):
  - zustand v5 store usage in specific components
  - puppeteer usage in scraper jobs
  - bullmq (listed as dep but may be unused currently)
```

### Critical Library Notes
- `@upstash/redis` (NOT ioredis) on Vercel — ioredis requires persistent TCP, crashes serverless
- `ioredis` is used ONLY in the scraper scheduler running on Railway containers
- `recharts` Tooltip `formatter` must NOT type-param as `(v: number)` — use `(v)` + `Number(v)` cast
- `react-simple-maps` is FRAGILE — see Section 7 for fix history. Never rewrite map components.
- Budget values stored in Rupees (NOT Crores) — display always divides by 1e7 to show Crores

## 5. DISTRICT HIERARCHY & ROUTING

```
LEVEL 0: Country     → forthepeople.in/
LEVEL 1: State       → /en/karnataka/
LEVEL 2: District    → /en/karnataka/mandya/
LEVEL 3: Taluk/Block → /en/karnataka/mandya/srirangapatna/ (future)
LEVEL 4: Village     → /en/karnataka/mandya/srirangapatna/ganjam/ (future)

ROUTE STRUCTURE:
  /[locale]/[state]/[district]/[module]/page.tsx
  Locale: "en" | "kn" (next-intl)
  State: slug (e.g., "karnataka")
  District: slug (e.g., "mandya", "mysuru", "bengaluru-urban")
  Module: one of 30 modules (see Section 6)

LOCK BEHAVIOR:
  Active district:  Full data, clickable

## 7. INTERACTIVE MAP (FRAGILE)

### History of Map Implementation (3 attempts)
```
Attempt 1: D3.js + custom SVG — abandoned (complex, GeoJSON winding bugs, world-spanning fills)
Attempt 2: Leaflet.js + react-leaflet — abandoned (SSR issues, complex setup for India map)
Attempt 3: react-simple-maps — FINAL (works, simpler API, easier India state highlighting)
```

### Current Implementation
- Library: `react-simple-maps` + `topojson-client`
- India SVG map: portrait viewBox 800×900, scale=900, center=[82.5,23]
  - J&K at approximately y=175, south tip at approximately y=696 — fits all of India
- GeoJSON: exterior rings MUST be CW (clockwise winding)
  - Despite RFC7946 claiming CCW, d3-geo in practice needs CW for correct exterior rings
  - Zero-area rings (< 1e-10 by shoelace area) cause world-spanning fills — always remove them
- MapErrorBoundary component wraps all map renders
- Cache bust: GeoJSON served with `?v=4` query
- GeoJSON Cache-Control: 24h in response headers
- Taluk map: `TalukMap.tsx` + `public/geo/mandya-taluks.json` (approximate polygons)

### Rules (CRITICAL — never violate)
```
NEVER modify map components unless you have verified the fix in the browser.
NEVER change viewBox dimensions without testing all 36 states render correctly.
Use Playwright to inspect SVG DOM when debugging — check path `d` attribute for extreme
  coords (x > 900 or x < -100 means world-spanning bug).
Use getBoundingClientRect per path to debug individual state renders.
```

## 9. 4 AI ENGINES

All AI calls go through `src/lib/ai-provider.ts` → `callAI()` and `callAIJSON()` unified gateway.
NEVER call Anthropic or Gemini APIs directly — always use callAI().

### ZERO-CREDIT RULE (CRITICAL — Backend Only)
Public API routes (`/api/ai/insight`, `/api/ai/citizen-tips`) are **READ-ONLY**.
They serve ONLY from Redis cache or DB — never call `callAI()` on public GET requests.
Returning null/empty instead of generating live AI prevents unauthorized billing.
- Cron routes (`/api/cron/generate-insights`) are protected by `x-cron-secret: CRON_SECRET`
- Admin routes require `ftp_admin_v1` cookie
- Direct AI key access is NEVER exposed to the client

### Provider Architecture
```
1. OpusCode.pro (Anthropic proxy)
   activeProvider = "anthropic", anthropicSource = "opuscode"
   Key stored: provider = "anthropic" in AdminAPIKey
   Base URL: process.env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL || settings.anthropicBaseUrl
   Auto-detection: if ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL contains "opuscode" → forces anthropicSource=opuscode

2. Official Anthropic
   activeProvider = "anthropic", anthropicSource = "official"
   Key stored: provider = "anthropic_official" in AdminAPIKey
   Base URL: "https://api.anthropic.com"

3. Google Gemini
   activeProvider = "gemini"
   Key stored: provider = "gemini" in AdminAPIKey
   Default model: gemini-2.5-flash
```

### Key Resolution Priority
1. DB-stored encrypted key (AdminAPIKey where provider = keyName, isActive = true)
2. Env var fallback: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY
3. Returns null → AI call fails gracefully

### Base URL Priority (CRITICAL)
```typescript
process.env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL || settings.anthropicBaseUrl || "https://api.anthropic.com"
// Env var MUST take priority over DB default — always
```

### Models
```
Gemini:     gemini-2.5-flash (default), gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-1.5-pro
Anthropic:  claude-opus-4-6 (default), claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### Response Parsing (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// CORRECT: find the text block — do NOT assume content[0] is text
const textBlock = response.content.find(b => b.type === 'text');
// Extended thinking: maxTokens MUST be >= 2048
// Extended thinking may add thinking blocks BEFORE the text block — always use .find()
```

### Engine 1: News Intelligence Pipeline
- Location: `src/scraper/jobs/news.ts` → `src/scraper/jobs/ai-analyzer.ts`
- Flow: RSS scraping → Gemini/Opus classification → targetModule + extractedData stored in NewsItem
- Schedule: Every 1 hour (news), analysis in ai-analyzer.ts
- Stores results as AIInsight records, then queues for admin review

### Engine 2: News Action Engine
- Location: `src/lib/news-action-engine.ts`
- Functions: `classifyArticleWithAI()` extracts structured data from news
- `executeNewsAction()` auto-executes DB mutations at confidence > 0.85
- Queues for human review at confidence 0.60–0.85
- Skips (discards) at confidence < 0.60
- Stores pending actions in `NewsActionQueue` model

### Engine 3: Pre-computed AI Module Insights
- Location: `src/lib/insight-generator.ts`
- Generates insights for 30 modules × all active districts
- Stored in `AIModuleInsight` with TTL/expiry field
- Generated every 2 hours by Vercel cron (`/api/cron/generate-insights`)
- On request: Redis → DB (check expiry) → generate fresh if expired
- Shown as `AIInsightCard` on 11 module pages
- Footer shows: "Source-verified by Claude/Gemini AI" with actual provider+model

### Engine 4: Opus Fact Checker
- Location: `src/lib/fact-checker.ts`
- Runs 25+ module-level checks
- Born-in-district rule: famous personalities must be born in the specific district
- Saves results to `FactCheckStatus` table with per-module breakdown
- Admin-accessible via Dashboard tab → FactChecker component
- POST `/api/admin/fact-check` — runs checks, returns issuesFound, staleItems, duplicates

## 10. DISTRICT HEALTH SCORE

### Algorithm (`src/lib/health-score.ts`)
```
10 Categories with BASE weights (total = 100%):
  governance       15%  — infrastructure + budget utilization + leadership
  education        12%  — school results + student-teacher ratio + coverage
  health           12%  — hospital beds + doctor ratio + coverage
  infrastructure   12%  — project completion + road density
  waterSanitation  10%  — dam levels + JJM coverage + water supply
  economy          10%  — crop prices + industries + employment
  safety           10%  — crime rate + police coverage
  agriculture       8%  — crop diversity + soil health + advisory
  digitalAccess     5%  — internet/mobile penetration
  citizenWelfare    6%  — scheme enrollment + RTI usage

District-type aware weights (getAdjustedWeights):
  metro   (pop>5M)       — boosts infrastructure+digitalAccess, reduces agriculture
  urban   (pop>1M)       — uses base weights
  semi-urban (density>500) — uses base weights
  rural   (default)      — boosts agriculture+waterSanitation, reduces infrastructure+digitalAccess

Precision:
  Category scores: 1 decimal (e.g. 72.4)
  Overall score:   2 decimal (e.g. 68.37)

Grade thresholds:
  A+ = score >= 90  |  A = score >= 80  |  B+ = score >= 70
  B  = score >= 60  |  C+ = score >= 50 |  C  = score >= 40
  D  = score >= 30  |  F  = score < 30

Breakdown includes: districtType, trendChange, trendDetails (per-category change >0.5 points)

Pre-computed: Weekly by cron, stored in DistrictHealthScore table.
Shown on: Homepage district cards, District overview page header.
```

### Current Pilot Scores
```
Mandya:          59.0 / 100  (C+)
Mysuru:          52.8 / 100  (C+)
Bengaluru Urban: 55.4 / 100  (C+)
Delhi (New Delhi): [pending — run health score calculation after testing]
```

## 11. FEATURE VOTING

### Architecture
- 23 feature requests seeded via `prisma/seed-features.ts`
- Models: `FeatureRequest` (title, description, votes, status, category) + `FeatureVote`
- Fingerprint: SHA-256(IP + User-Agent).slice(0, 32) — anonymous but unique per device
- Anti-double-vote: `@@unique([featureId, fingerprint])` constraint on FeatureVote
- Vote transaction: atomic `create` vote + `increment` count (prevents race condition)
- Page: `src/app/[locale]/features/page.tsx`

### Feature Categories
- data_modules, scrapers, ui_ux, community, technical, ai_features

### Status Values
- pending → planned → shipped

## 13. SCRAPER ARCHITECTURE

### Infrastructure
```
Container: Railway.app (Dockerfile.scraper) — runs 24/7 always-on
Scheduler: src/scraper/scheduler.ts — node-cron
Jobs dir:  src/scraper/jobs/*.ts (21 scrapers)
Logger:    src/scraper/logger.ts → ScraperLog DB table
Redis:     ioredis (NOT @upstash/redis) for Railway container
Districts: getActiveDistricts() queries prisma.district.findMany({ where: { active: true } })
           All scrapers are DB-driven — no hardcoded district arrays
```

### Dockerfile.scraper
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # npm ci FAILS due to peer dep conflicts
COPY . .
RUN npx prisma generate
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["npx", "tsx", "src/scraper/scheduler.ts"]
```

### Scraper Schedule
```
Every 5 min:   weather.ts       — OpenWeatherMap API (uses ctx.districtName, OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE)

```

### JobContext (scraper/types.ts)
```typescript
interface JobContext {
  districtId: string;
  districtSlug: string;
  districtName: string;  // Added for scalability — used by weather, crops
  stateName: string;     // Added for scalability — used by crops AGMARKNET
  stateSlug: string;
}
```

### Vercel Cron Jobs (in vercel.json)
```
/api/cron/scrape-news       — daily 6AM UTC    (news scrape + dedup + expire stale)
/api/cron/scrape-crops      — daily 3:30AM UTC (9AM IST — AGMARKNET crop prices all active districts)
/api/cron/generate-insights — every 2h         (pre-compute AI insights 30 modules × all districts)
```
Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET` header.
CRITICAL: CRON_SECRET must ONLY be read from the Authorization header — never from query params
(query params appear in server logs and browser history — security vulnerability).

## 15. API DESIGN

### Module Data API
```
GET /api/data/[module]?district=mandya&state=karnataka

Caching strategy:
  Layer 1: @upstash/redis (Redis cache) with per-module TTL
  Layer 2: Prisma query to Neon PostgreSQL

Module TTLs (from src/lib/cache.ts):
  weather:      5 minutes
  crops:        15 minutes
  water/dams:   30 minutes
  news:         60 minutes
  All others:   5 minutes default

Response includes:
  data: { ...moduleData }
  meta: { lastUpdated: timestamp, source: string }
```

### Cache Keys
```typescript
// Format: ftp:{module}:{districtSlug}
cacheKey('weather', 'mandya') → "ftp:weather:mandya"
```

### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- District page: `export const revalidate = 300` (5 minutes)
- GeoJSON files: Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400 (24 hours)
- API responses: Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300 (5 minutes)

## 16. ADMIN PANEL

URL: `forthepeople.in/en/admin`

### Navigation (April 2026 overhaul)
Unified left sidebar (`src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`) replaces the old
two-layer nav (top bar + sub-tab row). All admin routes share the sidebar via
`admin/layout.tsx`. Active item is derived from `pathname + ?tab=` query param.
Mobile (<1024px): hamburger button → slide-in overlay. Unread badges fetched
from `/api/admin/nav-counts` (alerts, review queue, feedback).

### 10 Tabs (grouped)
```

                        Revenue summary, AI Provider (OpenRouter live spend),
                        Recent Activity feed with filters
OPERATIONS

/en/admin?tab=alerts            AnalyticsDashboard, CostsTab render under AdminClient)
/en/admin?tab=analytics
/en/admin?tab=costs
/en/admin/ai-settings         — full-route pages (separate Next.js routes)
/en/admin/review
/en/admin/supporters          — Revenue & Supporters
/en/admin/feedback
/en/admin/security            — Access & 2FA
```

### New API Routes (April 2026)
```
GET  /api/admin/nav-counts        — Unread badge counts for sidebar
GET  /api/admin/dashboard-summary — Roll-up powering the Dashboard (30s Redis cache)
GET  /api/admin/openrouter-usage  — Real credit spend from OpenRouter /auth/key (5min cache)
POST /api/admin/run-scraper       — Manual scraper trigger per district + job
                                    ({ district: slug, job: "weather"|"news"|"crops"|"insights" })
DELETE /api/admin/scraper-logs    — Purge ScraperLog entries older than N days
```

### AI Settings Page (`/admin/ai-settings`)
```
3 provider cards with single-select "Activate" button
Active card: colored border + "ACTIVE" badge
Expandable API key input per card (hidden by default)

Provider mapping:
  OpusCode.pro     → activeProvider="anthropic", anthropicSource="opuscode", key="anthropic"
  Official Anthropic → activeProvider="anthropic", anthropicSource="official", key="anthropic_official"
  Google Gemini    → activeProvider="gemini", key="gemini"

API routes: GET/PUT /api/admin/ai-settings, POST/DELETE /api/admin/api-keys
            GET /api/admin/system-health (DB/Redis status, data freshness, scrapers, pending items)
            GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/alerts (AdminAlert CRUD with filters)
            GET /api/admin/analytics (district requests, feature votes, trends, totals)
```

### Fact Checker (`FactChecker.tsx`)
```
Runs: POST /api/admin/fact-check
Modules: leadership, budget, infrastructure, demographics, courts, news/alerts, all
Returns: totalItems, issuesFound, staleItems, duplicates, per-module results
Stored: FactCheckStatus table with durationMs, aiProvider, aiModel
GET returns last 20 checks
District selector: cascading State→District dropdown from /api/admin/districts
```

### Data Verifier
```
POST /api/admin/verify-data — AI QA of a specific module
Returns: issues[], suggestions[], confidence(0-100), status(ok/warning/error)
Graceful error: returns status:"error" NOT a 500 on AI failure
```

### Stale Data Management
```
GET  /api/admin/expire-stale    — preview stale alerts (shows count + oldest)
POST /api/admin/expire-stale    — expire alerts older than N days
POST /api/admin/deduplicate-news — dedup by normalized title prefix (keep newest)
POST /api/admin/cleanup-news    — comprehensive cleanup (x-admin-password header):
   1. Delete NewsItems older than 7 days
   2. Delete future-dated NewsItems (RSS parse errors)
   3. Delete duplicate articles by title prefix (keeps oldest per district+prefix)
   4. Delete auto-generated LocalAlerts older than 7 days
   5. Clear NewsActionQueue (pending + skipped items)
   6. Delete stale AIInsight records (module=alerts or createdAt >7 days)

GET /api/data/freshness?district=<slug> — traffic-light data freshness per module:
   Returns: { status: "green"|"amber"|"red"|"unknown", age, lastUpdated } per module
   Expected intervals: weather=10min, dam=60min, news/alerts/insights=120min, crops=1440min
```

### News Pipeline Quality Gates
```
isArticleFresh(): Reject if >3 days old, future-dated, or year < current-1
  - Google News RSS returns by relevance not recency; old articles silently reappear

isTitleDuplicate(): Normalize → first 5 words (len>3) → in-memory Set + DB lookup
  - Google News uses different redirect URLs for the same article (URL dedup alone insufficient)

classifyArticleWithAI(publishedAt): Injects article age into AI prompt
  - CRITICAL DATE RULE: events >2 days old → module=news, confidence ≤ 0.4, no alerts
```

## 17. SECURITY

### Admin Authentication
```
Cookie: ftp_admin_v1 = "ok" (HttpOnly, set by /admin login)
Password: ADMIN_PASSWORD env var (verified using timingSafeEqual — constant-time compare)
All admin API routes check isAuthed() which reads cookie
Alternative: x-admin-secret header (for direct API calls)
```

### 2FA (Google Authenticator TOTP)
```
Library: otpauth + qrcode
Secret: stored AES-256-CBC encrypted in AdminAuth.totpSecret
Setup: /api/admin/2fa/setup → scan QR → /api/admin/2fa/verify
Disable: /api/admin/2fa/disable
Recovery: /api/admin/2fa/recover → Resend email → /api/admin/2fa/recover/verify
Backup codes: 8 codes, stored encrypted JSON in AdminAuth.backupCodes
Rate limiting: failedAttempts counter, lockedUntil timestamp in AdminAuth
```

### Encryption (`src/lib/encryption.ts`)
```
Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
Key: ENCRYPTION_SECRET env var (32+ char random string)
Used for: AdminAPIKey.encryptedKey, AdminAuth.totpSecret, AdminAuth.backupCodes
Format: encrypt(plaintext) → "iv:ciphertext" (base64 encoded)
```

### Payment Security
```
Razorpay signature: HMAC-SHA256(orderId + "|" + paymentId, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET)
Comparison: timingSafeEqual (prevents timing attacks)
Webhook: same HMAC-SHA256 with RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### NEXT_PUBLIC Rules
```
ONLY these two keys may be NEXT_PUBLIC:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL         — https://forthepeople.in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID  — Razorpay key ID (needed for client-side checkout)
No other secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC — they ship to the browser
```

### Cron Authentication
```
Header: Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET
Env var: CRON_SECRET (set in Vercel dashboard)
Applies to: /api/cron/scrape-news, /api/cron/scrape-crops, /api/cron/generate-insights, /api/cron/news-intelligence
```
SECURITY RULE: Read CRON_SECRET from Authorization header ONLY.
Never accept it as a URL query param — URL params appear in server access logs and browser history.

### Rate Limiting
```
Library: src/lib/rate-limit.ts (Upstash Redis incr + expire)
Usage: await rateLimit(identifier, limit=60, window=60)
Fallback: if Redis unavailable, gracefully allows all requests (no crash)
Apply to: public API routes that could be abused
```

## 17B. CREATOR WATERMARKING

Deep watermarking to prove original authorship. Removing all marks requires touching 100+ files.

### Layers
```
1. Source code headers (219 source files):
   /**
    * ForThePeople.in — Your District. Your Data. Your Right.
    * © 2026 Jayanth M B. MIT License with Attribution.
    * https://github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople
    */

2. HTML <head> meta tags (src/app/layout.tsx metadata.other):
   original-author, project-inception, x-created-by, x-project-id, x-repository

3. JSON-LD WebApplication schema (layout.tsx):
   "@type": "WebApplication", "author": { "name": "Jayanth M B" }, "dateCreated": "2026-03-17"

4. HTTP Response headers (src/middleware.ts — every response):
   X-Powered-By: ForThePeople.in
   X-Creator: Jayanth M B
   X-Project-ID: FTP-JMB-2026-IN
   X-License: MIT with Attribution — github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople

5. package.json: author, repository, homepage, keywords, description

6. LICENSE file: MIT with Attribution (requires keeping original creator attribution)

7. public/humans.txt: Creator attribution for humans.txt standard

8. watermark.ts: CREATOR constant exported with projectId, inception date
```

### Watermark Utility (`src/lib/watermark.ts`)
```typescript
import { CREATOR, addWatermarkHeaders, getWatermarkMeta } from '@/lib/watermark';
// CREATOR.projectId = "FTP-JMB-2026-IN"
// CREATOR.inception = "2026-03-17"
// CREATOR.repository = "github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople"
```

### GitHub Repo
```
URL:     https://github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople (public after clean push)
History: Fresh single commit (no leaked secrets in history)
License: MIT with Attribution — requires creator credit in any fork
```

---

## 18. PERFORMANCE

### Lazy Loading
```typescript
// All heavy components use next/dynamic with ssr:false
const MapComponent = dynamic(() => import('./MapComponent'), { ssr: false });
const RechartChart = dynamic(() => import('./ChartComponent'), { ssr: false });
```

### Redis Caching Strategy
```
@upstash/redis REST client (not TCP — works in Vercel serverless)
TTLs:
  weather:   300s (5 min)
  crops:     900s (15 min)
  dams:      1800s (30 min)
  news:      3600s (1 h)
  default:   300s (5 min)
  ai insights: 21600s (6 h)
```

### Static & ISR
```
Homepage: fully static (getStaticProps equivalent)
District page: ISR revalidate=300 (5 minutes)
Module pages: ISR revalidate=300
GeoJSON: static files with Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400 (24h)
Sitemap: auto-generated from active districts (DB-driven)
```

### Mobile Performance
- Target: works on ₹8000 Android phones on 4G
- Min tap target: 44×44px (enforced in mobile sidebar and dropdowns)
- No heavy animations — only 200ms fade-in
- Recharts charts lazy-loaded to avoid SSR bundle size

---

## 19. PAYMENTS (RAZORPAY LIVE)

```
Keys: RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET, RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET (all in Vercel env)

4 Support Tiers on /en/support:
  Chai           (₹99)   — one-time
  Supporter      (₹499)  — one-time
  District Champion (₹1999) — one-time
  State Patron   (₹4999) — one-time

Payment Flow:
  1. POST /api/payment/create-order → creates Razorpay order, returns orderId
  2. Razorpay checkout modal on frontend (uses NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID)
  3. POST /api/payment/verify → HMAC-SHA256 sig verify, save to Contribution table
  4. POST /api/webhooks/razorpay → webhook backup (timingSafeEqual sig verify)
  5. GET  /api/payment/contributors → public contributor wall (isPublic=true only)

Admin Sync:
  POST /api/admin/sync-razorpay → fetch last 100 captured payments from Razorpay API
    - Skip captured=false payments
    - Dedup by paymentId
    - Upsert into Supporter table
    - After sync: SyncButton calls router.refresh() to update Server Component stats

Contributor Wall: shown on /support + compact version on homepage
```

---

## 19B. FINANCE SYSTEM (April 2026)

Three admin tabs under 💰 FINANCE, all backed by database queries — zero hardcoded values:

**Revenue & Supporters** (`/admin/supporters` — full route)
- Summary cards: total revenue, this month/week, supporter count, weekly trend %
- Monthly breakdown chart (last 12 months, revenue only)
- "Add Manual Supporter" modal: name, email, amount, tier, payment method, reference, date,
  sponsored district/state, social link, message, public toggle.
- Click any supporter row → inline edit modal (tier, district, state, message, public)
- Source badge: `MANUAL` pill on manually-added supporters vs Razorpay webhook rows
- Razorpay sync + CSV export (preserved from earlier iteration)
- Cache invalidation: `ftp:contributors:v1|all|leaderboard|district-rankings` are set to null with
  1s TTL on every manual add / edit so the public Wall refreshes immediately.

**Expenditure** (`/admin?tab=expenditure` — in-page tab)
- Summary cards: total expense, this month, net P&L (month), recurring monthly total
- Add/edit/delete expenses (modal): date, category, description, INR + USD amount with
  exchange rate snapshot, payment method, reference, invoice link, recurring interval, notes
- List view with category + recurring filter + search
- **P&L view** — monthly table comparing revenue vs expenses for last 12 months with Profit/Loss status
- CSV export of filtered rows
- **Invoice attachment: link-only for now.** `Expense.invoiceBlobUrl` reserved for future
  Vercel Blob upload — not wired (would need `@vercel/blob` + `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`).

**Costs & Billing** (`/admin?tab=costs` — in-page tab)
- Top summary: Monthly Cost (INR + USD), Yearly Cost, Expiring Soon count
- OpenRouter live credit spend card (from Prompt 1)
- AI usage + per-model estimated cost
- Subscription table with: displayName, plan, account email, INR+USD cost, purchase date,
  expiry countdown (red <7d, yellow ≤30d, red if past due), inline renewal date edit

### Models (prisma/schema.prisma)

**Subscription** (extended from Prompt 1; `ServiceSubscription` merged in):
  id, name, displayName, serviceName @unique, provider, category, plan,
  costINR, costUSD, currency, costOriginal, exchangeRate,
  billingCycle, purchaseDate, expiryDate, renewalDate (legacy), status,
  autoRenew, accountEmail, apiKeyEnvVar, dashboardUrl, notes

**Expense** (new):
  id, date, category, description, amountINR, amountUSD, exchangeRate,
  paymentMethod, referenceNumber, invoiceUrl, invoiceBlobUrl,
  isRecurring, recurringInterval, notes, createdBy

**Supporter** (extended): + `source "razorpay"|"manual"`, `referenceNumber`

## 22. SCALING — HOW TO ADD A NEW DISTRICT

### Step-by-Step Checklist

#### Step 1: Add to Hierarchy Seeder
```bash
# Edit prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts — add new State (if new) + District + Taluks
# Run against production Neon DB:
npx tsx prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts
```

#### Step 2: Add to Static Constants
```typescript
// Edit src/lib/constants/districts.ts
// Add to INDIA_STATES array (used for static routing + compare page)
// District becomes available in all DB-driven APIs automatically
```

#### Step 3: Handle Name Overrides (if needed)
```typescript
// src/scraper/jobs/weather.ts — add to OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE if OpenWeatherMap
// uses a different name than the district slug
OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE['new-district-slug'] = 'City Name For OWM';

// src/scraper/jobs/crops.ts — add to AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE if needed
AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE['new-district-slug'] = 'AGMARKNET Name';
```

#### Step 4: Seed Initial Data
```bash
# Create a seed file: prisma/seed-newdistrict.ts
# Seed: leadership, budget, demographics, infrastructure projects
npx tsx prisma/seed-newdistrict.ts
```

#### Step 5: Activate the District
```sql
-- In Neon DB console or via prisma:
UPDATE "District" SET active = true WHERE slug = 'new-district-slug';
```

#### Step 6: Automatic — Nothing Else Needed
After `active: true`, the following work automatically:
- All 30 module API routes (DB-driven by districtSlug)
- Scraper jobs (queries active districts from DB)
- Admin dropdowns (FactChecker, VerifySection)
- Homepage preview cards
- Sitemap generation
- District health score calculation
- AI insight generation (next cron run)
- News intelligence pipeline

### Future Schema Enhancements (tracked in SCALING-CHECKLIST.md)
```
[ ] Add owmCityName field to District model (replace OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE dict)
[ ] Add agmarknetName field to District model (replace AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE dict)
[ ] Full State→District cascading in admin panel (currently flat district list)
[ ] TalukSelector component on district overview page
```

### How to Add a New State
1. Add State + Districts + Taluks to `prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts` → run it
2. Add to `src/lib/constants/districts.ts` INDIA_STATES array
3. Add any regional font to `src/app/globals.css` @import (Noto Sans for the language)
4. Update OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE and AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE as needed
5. Activate districts → everything else is automatic

## 23. KNOWN CONSTRAINTS

### Vercel Limits
```
Function timeout: 5 minutes max (AI calls must complete within this)
Hobby plan crons: 1 cron job per day (we use Pro which allows multiple)
Background jobs: NOT supported — use Railway for always-on scrapers
Serverless: no persistent TCP connections → must use @upstash/redis REST (not ioredis)
```

### Railway
```
Scraper container: always-on Docker container (node-cron scheduler)
Not Vercel-compatible: uses ioredis which needs persistent TCP
Railway free tier: may sleep after inactivity — use paid tier for production
```

### Neon PostgreSQL
```
Free tier: 0.5GB storage limit
Connection pooling: Neon handles pooling; use adapter-pg, not direct pool management
Scale tier: needed once >3 active districts with real-time scraping
```

### Upstash Redis
```
Free tier: 10,000 requests/day limit
Production: needs paid tier once daily cron runs × active districts exceed limit
REST API only (no TCP): compatible with Vercel serverless
```

### AI Calls
```
OpusCode proxy: higher rate limits than official Anthropic API
Extended thinking: maxTokens MUST be >= 2048 for thinking to work
Response parsing: ALWAYS use content.find(b => b.type === 'text') — never content[0]
Gemini free tier: sufficient for current load (3 districts)
Cost scales: linearly with active districts × modules × cron frequency
```

## 25. COST ANALYSIS

```
Vercel Pro (zurvoapp):    ~$20/month (includes cron + preview deployments)
Neon PostgreSQL:          Free tier (0.5GB) — sufficient for 3 districts
                          Scale tier ~$20/month if >10 districts
Upstash Redis:            Free tier (10K req/day) — upgrade to $10/month at scale
Railway (scraper):        ~$5/month (always-on container, minimal CPU)
Razorpay:                 2% per transaction (no monthly fee)
Resend:                   Free (100 emails/day)
Gemini API:               Free tier sufficient for current load
Anthropic/OpusCode:       ~$10-20/month (Claude Opus calls for insights + fact-check)
Domain (forthepeople.in): ~₹800/year (~₹67/month)

CURRENT TOTAL:            ~₹2,500-3,500/month (~₹108/district/month for 3 districts)
AT SCALE (780 districts): ~₹108/district/year if infra scales linearly
                          Realistically ~₹5,000/month for 100 districts

## 27. ANTI-PATTERNS (Things That Don't Work And Why)

### Libraries to Never Use on Vercel
```
ioredis        — Requires persistent TCP connection. Crashes Vercel serverless functions.
                 Use @upstash/redis (REST-based) instead.
bullmq         — Also requires ioredis. Do not use in Next.js API routes.
node-cron      — Does not work in Vercel serverless. Use Vercel cron + /api/cron/ routes.
puppeteer      — Too heavy for Vercel (memory limit). Use only in Railway scraper container.
```

### Map Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Change react-simple-maps viewBox without testing all 36 states
Never: Use CCW winding for GeoJSON exterior rings (d3-geo needs CW despite RFC7946)
Never: Forget to remove zero-area rings (area < 1e-10) — they cause world-spanning fills
Never: Use D3.js for the India map (too complex, was abandoned)
Never: Use Leaflet for the main India map (SSR issues, was abandoned)
```

### AI Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Call Anthropic or Gemini APIs directly — always use callAI() from ai-provider.ts
Never: Assume content[0] is the text block — use content.find(b => b.type === 'text')
Never: Set maxTokens < 2048 when using extended thinking
Never: Let ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL default to DB value — env var MUST take priority
Never: Hardcode "gemini" as the AI provider — read from AIProviderSettings in DB
```

### Database Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Store budget values in Crores — always store in Rupees, display ÷1e7
Never: Overwrite previous leadership records — ADD only, never delete historical leaders
Never: Add famous personality without verifying bornInDistrict = true for their district
       Example: Dr. Rajkumar was born in Erode, TN — NOT in Mandya (removed after error)
Never: Use `headline` field on NewsItem — the field is `title` (was a bug)
Never: Assume ElectionResult is per-candidate — it's per-constituency (winnerName/winnerParty)
```

### Deployment Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Run `npx vercel --prod` directly (causes Vercel scope switching issues)
       Always: git push origin main → auto-deploy
Never: Commit with git user.email != jayanthmbj@gmail.com (Vercel rejects deployment)
Never: Use `git commit --amend` after a failed pre-commit hook (amends PREVIOUS commit)
       Always: Fix the issue, re-stage, create a NEW commit
Never: Use `npm ci` in Dockerfile.scraper (peer dep conflicts — use npm install --legacy-peer-deps)
```

### Code Pattern Anti-Patterns
```
Never: recharts Tooltip formatter typed as (v: number) → TypeScript error
       Always: (v) + Number(v) cast
Never: Set overflow:hidden on the nav element (clips dropdown menus)
       Always: overflow:visible on Header nav
Never: Hardcode district or state names in API routes (use dynamic DB queries)
Never: Put secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars except NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
Never: Accept CRON_SECRET as a URL query param (leaks in server logs/browser history)
       Always: read from Authorization: Bearer header only
Never: Use unbounded findMany() on high-cardinality tables (schools, elections)
       Always: add take: N (schools take:200, elections take:100)
```

## 29. EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS (April 2026)

### Sentry Error API
Reads unresolved issues and surfaces them inside Alerts & Logs tab + Dashboard banner.
- `src/lib/sentry-api.ts` — REST client (sentry.io/api/0)
- `src/app/api/admin/sentry-errors/route.ts` — cookie-auth endpoint, 5min Redis cache
- `src/components/admin/SentryErrorsSection.tsx` — rendered at top of Alerts & Logs
- Env: `SENTRY_API_TOKEN` (not SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN — that's build-time), `SENTRY_ORG`,
  `SENTRY_PROJECT`. Token requires `event:read` + `project:read` scopes.
- Graceful: shows setup instructions when unconfigured.

### Plausible Stats API
Powers the Traffic tab with real-time visitors, top pages, referrers, devices, countries.
- `src/lib/plausible-api.ts` — `fetchAllPlausibleData(period)` returns all blocks in one go
- `src/app/api/admin/traffic/route.ts` — cookie-auth, 3min cache, supports 7d/30d/90d/month/year
- `src/app/[locale]/admin/TrafficTab.tsx` — in-page tab (`?tab=traffic`)
- Env: `PLAUSIBLE_API_KEY`, `PLAUSIBLE_SITE_ID` (default: forthepeople.in)
- Graceful: setup instructions when unconfigured.
- "View Full Analytics" button links to plausible.io dashboard.

### API Key Vault (April 2026)
- Models: `AdminAPIKey` (extended: envVarName, maskedKey, notes, lastAccessedAt, lastAccessedBy, addedBy)
- Gate: separate TOTP verification (`ftp_vault_session` cookie, 10-min Redis TTL, bound to admin
  cookie hash so the session can't be replayed from another browser)
- Reveal: POST `/api/admin/vault/[id]/reveal` — decrypts via `src/lib/encryption.ts`, rate limited
  to 5 reveals per session, auto-hidden after 30s client-side
- `/api/admin/vault` GET (list masked + env reference), POST (add/upsert)
- `/api/admin/vault/[id]` GET, PATCH, DELETE
- `/api/admin/vault/unlock` POST, `/api/admin/vault/session` GET/DELETE
- Seed: `scripts/seed-vault-keys.ts` — reads known env vars + stores encrypted. Idempotent.
- Every vault action writes an AdminAuditLog entry.

### Multi-user Admin (Foundation — future work)
- Models: `AdminUser` (username, passwordHash [bcryptjs], role, permissions, totpSecret),
  `AdminAuditLog` (actorLabel, action, resource, resourceId, details, ipAddress, userAgent)
- Roles: `owner` (full access), `admin` (no vault/users), `viewer` (Dashboard/Health/Analytics/Traffic)
- `/api/admin/users` GET/POST, `/api/admin/users/[id]` PATCH/DELETE (soft delete → isActive=false)
- Scaffolding only: ADMIN_PASSWORD cookie still gates all admin routes. Per-user login remains
  a future task — the table is populated so role-based UI filtering can be wired later.

### Audit Logging
- `src/lib/audit-log.ts`: `logAudit()` + `logAuditAuto()` (auto-extracts IP + UA from headers).
- Never throws — audit write failures are logged to stderr but don't break the main operation.
- Viewer: `/api/admin/audit-log` with filters (action, adminUserId, resource, date range),
  rendered as paginated table on Security page with CSV export.
- Instrumented: vault ops, manual-supporter, supporter edit, expense add/edit/delete,
  platform-report manual generation, user create/update/deactivate.

### Content Editor (April 2026)
- New tab under ⚙️ Operations: `/admin?tab=content-editor`.
- Selects State → District, shows module grid with editable cards.
- Inline table editor for a vetted allowlist (`CONTENT_MODULES` in
  `src/app/api/admin/content/route.ts`): 13 modules — leaders, infrastructure,
  schemes, offices, police, schools, famous personalities, budget entries,
  court stats, industries, service guides, election results, bus routes.
  Scraper-generated modules (weather/news/crops/dams/power/alerts) stay read-only.
  Hospital module skipped (no Hospital Prisma model yet).
- `GET /api/admin/content?district=&module=` lists editable rows + field list.
- `POST /api/admin/content/save` applies updates/creates/deletes, invalidates
  Redis cache keys (`ftp:<slug>:<module>` + `ftp:<slug>:overview`), and
  writes UpdateLog + AdminAuditLog entries for every change.

### Update Log
- Model: `UpdateLog(source, actorLabel, tableName, recordId, action, fieldName,
  oldValue, newValue, districtId, districtName, moduleName, description)`
- Util: `src/lib/update-log.ts` → `logUpdate()` (never throws).
- UI tab: `/admin?tab=update-log` with source/module filters, date grouping,
  expandable old/new diff view, CSV export.

### Admin Bot
- Floating bottom-right widget, rendered in `admin/layout.tsx`.
- Pattern-matched queries answered from the DB with zero AI cost:
  revenue/expense totals, stale districts, pending review/feedback/alerts,
  counts, and a parser for `Add expense: <description> ₹<amount>` (supports
  $ → ₹ conversion at ₹84/$1).
- Unmatched prompts return a requires-AI nudge directing the user to the
  Dashboard Platform Report for real analysis.
- Message history in `AdminBotMessage`.

### Cost + Alert Hygiene (April 2026)
- `/api/cron/generate-insights` schedule: `0 */2 * * *` → `0 0,12 * * *`
  (every 2h → twice daily). Combined with existing per-module TTLs this cuts
  OpenRouter spend dramatically. `FREE_FALLBACK_MODELS` reordered to try
  `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b:free` first since OSS-20b:free has been hitting
  200 req/day limits.
- **News classification (April 13):** `news-analysis` purpose moved from
  Gemini 2.5 Pro ($1.25/M) to `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`. In `scraper/jobs/news.ts`
  the keyword classifier runs first — AI only fires when keyword returns
  "news"/null OR the article lands in an `ACTIONABLE_MODULES` category
  (infrastructure / alerts / exams / staffing / leaders / police / health /
  power / schemes) where we want structured data extraction.
- **Data-change detection (April 13):** `hasDataChanged(districtId, module)`
  in `src/lib/insight-generator.ts` checks whether the source table has rows
  newer than the last AIModuleInsight.generatedAt. For modules whose tables
  lack an updatedAt/createdAt timestamp (Leader, PoliceStation, School,
  BudgetEntry, ElectionResult, Scheme, CourtStat, LocalIndustry,
  FamousPersonality) the check falls back to a 14-day staleness ceiling.
  Skipped generations log to stdout, not AdminAlert.
- **Estimated daily spend after all cuts:** $0.02–0.05 (was ~$2/day).
- `src/lib/admin-alerts.ts`: `isTransientError()` filter skips email + DB
  alerts for fetch-failed / timeout / 5xx / ECONN* / aborted errors.
  `alertScraperFailed` and `alertCronFailed` short-circuit when the error
  matches. Freshness panel still reflects stale state so the problem remains
  visible — we just stop paging. Dashboard recent-activity feed drops them too.

### AI Platform Analysis
Weekly AI-generated platform health report with action items + cost tips.
- Model: `PlatformReport` (type, summary, actionItems, metrics, costTips, growthNotes,
  aiModel, aiProvider, aiCostUSD, generatedAt)
- `src/lib/platform-analysis.ts` — gathers 7-day snapshot + calls Gemini 2.5 Pro via callAIJSON
- `src/app/api/admin/platform-report/route.ts` — GET latest + estimate, POST with
  `?confirm=true` to generate
- `src/app/api/cron/platform-report/route.ts` — Sundays 00:00 UTC via vercel.json
- `src/components/admin/PlatformReportCard.tsx` — Dashboard card with two-step generate flow
- Approx cost: $0.002 (~₹0.20) per report. Cheaper than the prompt's ~$0.01 estimate because
  the actual prompt fits in ~1.7K tokens.
- Weekly cron needs `CRON_SECRET` set; manual trigger from Dashboard works independently.

### Contributors & Sponsorship System (April 13, 2026 — COMPLETE)
Complete overhaul of the contributor/sponsor system: pricing tiers, expiry,
variable-based labels, per-district + per-state contributor pages, corporate
sponsor banner, homepage showcase, admin CRUD, growth chart, performance
pagination, and dynamic Razorpay plans.

**Tier structure (5 cards, Indian hook lines — `src/lib/constants/razorpay-plans.ts`):**
- `custom` — One-Time Contribution · ₹10–50,000 (default ₹50) · "Even ₹50 keeps
  one district's data running for a day"
- `district` — District Champion · ₹99–1,998/mo (default ₹99) · featured · "₹99/mo
  — one less Zomato order, one more district with free data 🍛"
- `state` — State Champion · ₹1,999–9,998/mo · "₹67/day — an auto ride's worth"
- `patron` — All-India Patron · ₹9,999–49,998/mo · "780 districts. 22,620 dashboards"
- `founder` — Founding Builder · ₹50,000–99,000/mo · "Royal Contributor"
- Every tier has `minAmount`, `maxAmount`, `step`, `hookLine`, `isRecurring`.
- `chai` kept in `TIER_PRIORITY` + `getContributorLabel` for backward compat with
  pre-merger DB records (they render as "Supporter").

**Dynamic Razorpay plan creation (CRITICAL):**
- `src/app/api/payment/create-subscription/route.ts` no longer uses preset
  `RAZORPAY_PLANS`. Each subscription creates a new Razorpay plan with the
  user's exact amount from the +/- buttons.
- `SupportCheckout.tsx` passes the clamped `amount` to both create-subscription
  and verify-subscription routes.
- `verify-subscription/route.ts` saves the actual amount on the Supporter row
  (both upsert branches).
- Preset `RAZORPAY_PLANS` constants remain but are no longer referenced in code.

**Amount clamping + validation:**
- UI: +/- buttons use `tier.step`, disable at min/max, blur-snap rounds to step
  within `[minAmount, maxAmount]`. Number input respects the same bounds.
- Server: `create-order` and `create-subscription` enforce
  `minAmount ≤ amount ≤ maxAmount` per tier.

**Expiry system (`src/lib/contribution-expiry.ts`):**
- `calculateOneTimeExpiry(amount, from)` — ≥₹2000 = 90d, ≥₹500 = 60d, else 30d.
- `calculateFounderGrace()` — 90d post-cancellation grace for founders.
- `calculateStandardGrace()` — 30d fallback for other cancellations.
- Active subscriptions have `expiresAt: null` (Razorpay manages renewals).
- Public API filters: `OR: [{ expiresAt: null }, { expiresAt: { gt: new Date() } }]`.
- One-time cards show "Active until {date}" / "Expires in N days" via
  `formatExpiryLabel()` in `ContributorsClient`.
- Migration script: `scripts/migrate-existing-contributor-expiry.ts` backfills
  `expiresAt` for pre-existing one-time rows based on amount + createdAt; grants
  30-day grace if calculated expiry already passed. Also clears stale
  `expiresAt` on active subscriptions.

**Dynamic labels (`src/lib/contributor-label.ts`):**
- `getContributorLabel(tier, districtName, stateName)` returns
  "Mandya Champion", "Karnataka Champion", "India Patron", "Royal Contributor",
  "Chai Supporter" (legacy), "Supporter" (custom/unknown).
- Used by `ContributorsClient`, `GlobalContributorsClient`, `PatronCard`,
  `DistrictSponsorBanner`, `StateSponsorSection`, `TopTierShowcase`.

**Social link validation (`src/lib/social-detect.ts`):**
- New `validateSocialLink(input)` returns `{ valid, platform, cleanUrl, warning }`.
- UI shows green checkmark (`✓ {Platform} link detected`), orange warning
  (`⚠ Could not verify — please double-check`), red error (`✗ Invalid format`).

**API (`src/app/api/data/contributors/route.ts`) — paginated + typed:**
- Every endpoint accepts `?limit=` and `?offset=`, returns `total`.
- `?type=top-tier&limit=20` — founders + patrons for homepage.
- `?district=&state=&limit=500` — district page (all tiers including one-time).
- `?type=state-page&state=&limit=60` — state-level sponsors (India + state tier).
- `?type=leaderboard&limit=10` — top active subscribers by tenure.
- `?type=growth-trend` — `{ points: [{ month, newCount, cumulative }, …] }`.
- `?type=district-rankings` — aggregated monthly totals per district.
- No params — paginated `{ subscribers, oneTime, subscribersTotal, oneTimeTotal }`.
- DB orderBy: `[{ amount: "desc" }, { activatedAt: "asc" }]` so richest
  contributor shows first. Public response nulls `amount` for recurring rows
  (only one-time amounts are shown). Hard ceiling `HARD_MAX = 500`.
- Select includes `sponsoredDistrict` + `sponsoredState` so the response carries
  `districtName`, `stateName`, `districtSlug`, `stateSlug`.

**UI components — new:**
- `src/components/common/CorporateSponsorBanner.tsx` — dashed-border CTA banner
  at the top of every district's contributors page with email + Instagram contacts.
- `src/components/common/StateSponsorSection.tsx` — 2-line ticker (India / State
  Champions) rendered below the district grid on `/[locale]/[state]/page.tsx`.
- `src/components/common/ContributorGrowthChart.tsx` — Recharts AreaChart above
  the global leaderboard. Shows cumulative growth + "+X new this month".
- `src/components/support/TopTierShowcase.tsx` — slim homepage strip
  (`🏆 Backed By`) with CSS `@keyframes ticker-scroll` (60s desktop, 45s mobile,
  pause on hover, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`). Limited to 20 via
  `?limit=20`. Renders nothing when no top-tier contributors.

**UI components — redesigned:**
- `ContributorsClient.tsx` (district page) — 6 sections in order:
  1. CorporateSponsorBanner, 2. {District} Champions, 3. {State} Champions,
  4. India Patrons & Royal Contributors, 5. One-Time Supporters, 6. Bottom CTA.
  Each section caps at 20 cards initially; horizontal scroll with arrow buttons
  (desktop) and touch swipe (mobile); "Show more (+X)" expands by 40 up to a
  `MAX_RENDERED = 200` hard cap. Empty sections show a "Be the first {District}
  Champion" soft CTA.
- `DistrictSponsorBanner.tsx` (overview ticker) — 3 lines: 👑 India, 🇮🇳 {State},
  🏛️ {District}. Each line caps at 15 chips with "+X more" chip linking to the
  contributors page. Mobile: chip labels shrink to 11px, line label wraps.
- `ContributorWall.tsx` (support page wall) — capped at 50 one-time + 30
  subscribers; animation duration `wall-scroll` slowed from 30s to 90s so names
  are readable. "View all {total} →" link shown when oneTimeTotal > 50.
- `GlobalContributorsClient.tsx` (/contributors) — grows chart + paginated list
  (50 per page, "Load more" loads next 50 via `limit = PAGE_SIZE × page`);
  filter=one-time preset from URL param so the support-page wall link works.

**Homepage:**
- `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` renders `<TopTierShowcase />` above
  `HomeDrilldown` + existing `CompactContributorWallClient`.

**Support page (`src/app/support/page.tsx`):**
- 5 tier cards (chai merged into custom), each shows hook line beneath the
  description. Passes full props (`minAmount`, `maxAmount`, `step`, `hookLine`)
  to `SupportCheckout`. Bottom CTA uses the `custom` tier (was `chai`).
- "View full contributor leaderboard →" link added under the wall.
- Post-payment success screen instructs users to email
  `support@forthepeople.in` to update social link or display name later.

**Admin — manual contributor CRUD (`src/app/[locale]/admin/supporters/`):**
- `ManualSupporterForm.tsx` updated: 5 new tiers (no chai), One-Time/Monthly
  radio that auto-infers from tier preset, Expires On date picker
  (auto-calculated for one-time unless overridden).
- `src/app/api/admin/manual-supporter/route.ts` accepts `isRecurring`,
  `expiresAt`, `paymentDate`; defaults expiry via `calculateOneTimeExpiry` for
  one-time rows; sets `subscriptionStatus: "active"` + `activatedAt` for
  monthly; stamps `paymentId: "manual_<ts>_<rand>"`; invalidates
  `ftp:contributors:*` (including new `top-tier` key).

**Dev-only mock mode (`src/lib/mock-contributors.ts`):**
- `isMockEnabled()` double-gated: requires `FTP_MOCK_CONTRIBUTORS=1` AND
  `NODE_ENV === "development"`. Production-safe even if env var leaks.
- Deterministic pool (mulberry32, seed=42) of 10,000 contributors with
  realistic tier distribution and Indian names.
- Helpers: `mockTopTier`, `mockDistrict`, `mockStatePage`, `mockLeaderboard`,
  `mockDistrictRankings`, `mockGrowthTrend`, `mockAll` — each applies the same
  "null amount for recurring" projection as the real API's `toPublic()`.
- Wired into the API at the very top of the handler; skipped in prod.

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/seed-bulk-dummy-contributors.ts` — writes up to 10,000 `[TEST]`
  contributors to the DB for load/visual testing. **Cleanup required before
  any push:** `npx tsx -r dotenv/config scripts/cleanup-test-contributors.ts`.
  DB is shared with production — never run the seed without also running the
  cleanup.
- `scripts/migrate-existing-contributor-expiry.ts` — one-shot backfill
  (40 real one-time contributors got natural expiries on 2026-04-13, 4 active
  subscriptions had stale expiresAt cleared).
- `scripts/cleanup-test-contributors.ts` — pre-existing, wipes any row where
  `name LIKE "[TEST]%"` OR `email LIKE "%@test.forthepeople.in"`.

**Cache invalidation:**
- Verify + verify-subscription + manual-supporter now include
  `"ftp:contributors:top-tier"` in the invalidation list.
- Redis `SCAN match: ftp:contributors:*` used when bulk-busting after DB writes.

### Contributors — Final UX Polish (April 14, 2026 — COMPLETE)
Post-launch polish pass on the contributor system. No feature changes, only
presentation + performance.

**District overview section order (shared across ALL districts):**
1. Hero (name, badges, population, illustration)
2. **Combined Supporters + Sponsor CTA card** (cool slate `#F8FAFC` on
   `#E2E8F0` border — intentionally distinct from AI Analysis's warm orange)
3. AI Analysis card
4. District Health Score
5. Active Alerts → rest of the dashboard

The old separate "SPONSORED BY" amber banner + grey sponsor CTA bar are gone.
Both collapsed into one slate card in `DistrictSponsorBanner.tsx`.

**Per-line independent auto-scroll (`DistrictSponsorBanner.tsx`):**
- Three rows (👑 India / 🇮🇳 State / 🏛️ District) measure their own overflow
  via `ResizeObserver` + `scrollWidth` vs `clientWidth + 50` slack.
- Each animates at its own speed only when it overflows:
  India **120s**, State **90s**, District **60s** (slower at the top so the
  highest-value tier reads clearest).
- `onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave` toggle `animationPlayState` so hovering any
  chip pauses that row only; leaving resumes from the paused position.
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables all animations.
- Non-overflowing rows show an inline "View all →" chip at the end instead.
- Sponsor CTA sits inside the same card under a subtle `border-top` separator
  with red-accent "❤️ Sponsor {District} — ₹99/mo" + secondary state/patron lines.

**Support page contributor wall (`ContributorWall.tsx`):**
- Animation slowed to **180s** (3-min gentle drift). Was 30s → 90s → 180s as
  Jayanth tuned the readability.
- One-time cards capped at 50; subscribers at 30; "View all X →" link shown
  when totals exceed those caps.

**District contributor rows (`ContributorsClient.tsx`):**
- Each section row (District / State / India / One-Time) auto-scrolls (90s
  desktop, 60s mobile) when ≥4 cards; pauses on hover at the viewport level;
  reduced-motion falls back to native horizontal scroll.
- Count badges next to section headers are now buttons — clicking "🏛️ {District}
  Champions 204" opens a full-screen `ViewAllModal` with a responsive grid of
  all contributors, Esc / click-outside to close, body scroll-locked.

**Homepage `TopTierShowcase.tsx`:**
- CSS `@keyframes ticker-scroll` 60s desktop / 45s mobile; duplicates the
  items for seamless loop; pause-on-hover via `:hover .ftp-ticker-track`;
  respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Only loops when >6 chips.

**Global `/[locale]/contributors` page (`GlobalContributorsClient.tsx`):**
- Gradient hero ("The People Behind the Platform") with 3 stat cards
  (total supporters, active monthly, districts sponsored) + "Join the Movement
  — from ₹99/mo →" CTA.
- 💡 WHY IT MATTERS card under hero — counts are derived dynamically from
  `getTotalActiveDistrictCount()` × `MODULES_PER_DISTRICT`. No hardcoded "9"
  anywhere.
- Top-3 leaderboard rows get gold/silver/bronze `border-left: 4px` tints.
- 🔥 NEW badge on contributors who joined in the last 7 days.
- ⭐ LONGEST badge on the #1 by tenure (from leaderboard API).
- Growth chart + "Every district needs a champion. Will you be one?" bottom
  CTA moved after the Load-more section.

**Growth trend:**
- API query filtered to `createdAt >= 2026-04-01` (project launch). Applies
  to both real Prisma query and `mockGrowthTrend()`.
- `ContributorGrowthChart.tsx` renders a stat card ("📊 April 2026 · X new this
  month · Tracking since April 2026") when fewer than 2 months of data exist,
  and auto-swaps to the Recharts `AreaChart` once 2+ months are available.

**Support page prominence (`/support/page.tsx`):**
- New `ContributorCountBanner.tsx` (plain `fetch`, no QueryClient — this page
  sits outside `[locale]` layout where the provider lives) shows gold
  "🏆 N people already backing India's data revolution · View leaderboard →"
  above the tier cards.
- "View full contributor leaderboard →" link added beneath the wall.
- Dynamic district/state counts via `getTotalActiveDistrictCount()` +
  `getActiveStateCount()` — no more hardcoded "9 active districts".

**Helper utilities added to `src/lib/constants/districts.ts`:**
- `getTotalActiveDistrictCount()` — sum of active districts across all states.
- `getActiveStateCount()` — states with ≥1 active district.
Use these anywhere UI copy references live-district numbers — they auto-update
as new districts launch.
