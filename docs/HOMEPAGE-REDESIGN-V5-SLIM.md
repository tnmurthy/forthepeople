# Homepage Redesign v5 — Slim Core Reference (Session 11, 2026-04-26)

This is the in-repo reference for the Session 11 redesign. Built component-by-component as drop-in replacements; **page.tsx swap landed as commit `3dd7570`**. Layout-level chrome (legacy DisclaimerBar + Header + Footer in `[locale]/layout.tsx`) is intentionally preserved — see "Deferred" section below for the elevation plan.

---

## Layout map (compose order in `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`)

```
<DisclaimerBar />     ← LAYOUT (legacy, preserved)
<Header />            ← LAYOUT (legacy, preserved)
<main>
  <FinancialTicker />
  <LiveActivityRibbon />
  <HeroSection />
  <DistrictExplorer />
  <LiveDataShowcase />
  <FoundingPatronCard />
  <SupporterMarquee />
  <PricingTiers />
  <RequestAndVoteCards />
</main>
<Footer />            ← LAYOUT (legacy, preserved)
```

All redesign-v2 components live in `src/components/home/redesign-v2/`.

The `redesign-v2/DisclaimerBanner.tsx`, `redesign-v2/HeaderBar.tsx`, `redesign-v2/Footer.tsx` are built, TSC-clean, and ready to be elevated to `[locale]/layout.tsx` in a follow-up commit (after district pages are also re-themed).

## Tier color reference

| Tier | Price | Background | Text | Border | Badge |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| District Champion | ₹99/mo | `#DCFCE7` (emerald-100) | `#166534` (emerald-700) | `#86EFAC` | ⌂ |
| State Champion (most popular) | ₹999/mo | `#EEEDFE` (violet-50) | `#3C3489` (violet-900) | `#6E59C0` (violet-600) | ⛳ |
| All-India Patron | ₹9,999/mo | `#FCEBEB` (red-50) | `#791F1F` (red-900) | `#E24B4A` (red-600) | ★ |
| Founding Builder | ₹50,000/mo | `#FAEEDA` (amber-50) | `#78350F` (amber-900) | `#BA7517` (amber-600) | ♛ |
| Buy me a Chai (one-time) | from ₹50 | `#F5F5F0` (neutral-100) | `#6B7280` (neutral-500) | `#E5E7EB` | ☕ |

These match the production /support page CTAs and `BadgeExplainer.tsx`. Verified Session 11 audit phase.

## Animation list

| Element | Animation | Duration | reduced-motion fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| FinancialTicker | left→right marquee | 60s linear infinite | overflow-x: auto, no animation |
| LiveActivityRibbon | left→right marquee | 90s linear infinite | overflow-x: auto, no animation |
| LiveActivityRibbon green dot | opacity pulse | 2s ease-in-out infinite | no animation |
| HeroSection | fade-in on mount | 300ms ease-out | no animation |
| LiveDataShowcase tab switch | cross-fade | 250ms ease-out | no animation |
| FoundingPatronCard | gold glow pulse | 4s ease-in-out infinite | no animation |
| SupporterMarquee | left→right marquee | 50s linear infinite | overflow-x: auto, no animation |
| PricingTiers (state-champion card) | violet glow pulse | 4s ease-in-out infinite | no animation |
| HeaderBar updated-pill green dot | opacity pulse | 2s ease-in-out infinite | no animation |
| DisclaimerBanner | slide-in | 250ms ease-out | no animation |
| Hover lifts (cards) | translateY(-1px) | 150ms ease | no transform |

All animations use raw CSS keyframes — `framer-motion` is **not** installed.

## Mobile breakpoints (single threshold: 768px)

Each component declares its own `@media (max-width: 767px)` rules inline (Tailwind v4 + scoped `<style>` per component). Key collapses:

| Component | Desktop | Mobile (<768px) |
|---|---|---|
| HeaderBar | logo · product ▾ · pill · search · ☼/☾ · lang · GitHub · ♥ | logo · search · ♥ · ☰ |
| HeroSection | 60/40 grid (text · map) | stacks; map below; stats 2×3 |
| DistrictExplorer | 50/50 grid (map · list) | map above, list below |
| LiveDataShowcase chips | horizontal scroll | horizontal scroll |
| LiveDataShowcase cards | 4 columns | 2×2 grid |
| PricingTiers | 1fr 1.1fr 1fr | stacked; State Champion middle |
| RequestAndVoteCards | 2 columns | stacked |
| Footer rows | inline | stacked |

## Endpoints (no schema changes; no new endpoints)

| Component | Endpoint(s) consumed |
|---|---|
| FinancialTicker | GET `/api/data/market-ticker` |
| LiveActivityRibbon | GET `/api/data/homepage-stats`, GET `/api/data/homepage-preview` |
| HeroSection | GET `/api/data/homepage-stats` |
| DistrictExplorer | server-side `prisma.district.findMany` + `prisma.districtRequest.findMany` (props-in pattern via page.tsx) |
| LiveDataShowcase | GET `/api/data/crops`, `/weather`, `/news`, `/infrastructure-projects` per district chip |
| FoundingPatronCard | GET `/api/payment/contributors?limit=20` |
| SupporterMarquee | GET `/api/payment/contributors?limit=100` |
| PricingTiers | static — links to `/<locale>/support?tier=...&autoselect=...` |
| RequestAndVoteCards | GET + POST `/api/district-request`, GET `/api/features` |
| HeaderBar updated-pill | GET `/api/data/homepage-stats` (60s poll) |
| Footer updated-pill | GET `/api/data/homepage-stats` (60s poll) |

## /public/districts/{slug}.svg slot

`LiveDataShowcase` performs a `HEAD /districts/<slug>.svg` probe per active district. If the SVG exists, it renders as a 56px round avatar in the header. If not, a generic blue location-pin SVG renders. **Drop new SVGs into `public/districts/` to upgrade — zero code change required.**

Example: `public/districts/mandya.svg`, `public/districts/pune.svg`.

## Session 11.1 — Chrome swap completed (2026-04-26)

The redesign-v2 chrome (DisclaimerBanner + HeaderBar + Footer) is now wired into `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` and renders **site-wide**, not just on the homepage.

**Verified post-swap (HTTP 200 + reasonable HTML size):**

| Route | Status | Size |
|---|---|---|
| /en | 200 | 87 KB |
| /en/karnataka/mandya | 200 | 127 KB |
| /en/karnataka/bengaluru-urban | 200 | 127 KB |
| /en/karnataka/mysuru | 200 | 127 KB |
| /en/maharashtra/mumbai | 200 | 125 KB |
| /en/maharashtra/pune | 200 | 122 KB |
| /en/delhi/new-delhi | 200 | 123 KB |
| /en/tamil-nadu/chennai | 200 | 124 KB |
| /en/west-bengal/kolkata | 200 | 124 KB |
| /en/telangana/hyderabad | 200 | 133 KB |
| /en/uttar-pradesh/lucknow | 200 | 126 KB |

TSC: 0 errors. Lint: 107 problems (exactly baseline, no regression).

**Intentional regressions vs legacy Header (each documented inline in `HeaderBar.tsx` SCOPE NOTE):**
- No state/district autocomplete (search submits to `/<locale>?q=...`)
- No "Lock" indicator per-district
- No MobileSidebar wired (HeaderBar's ☰ button is a no-op until layout passes `onOpenMobileNav` callback wired to existing MobileSidebar)
- Footer trades the live IST clock for an "Updated Xm ago" pill

## v6 simplification (Session 11.6, 2026-04-27)

Localhost review of the v5 homepage flagged it as over-engineered: too many salesy sections (pricing tiers + big founder card + supporter marquee), redundant district browsers (explorer with tier groups + live-data 4-card showcase), and a dual request-and-vote card. v6 collapses the homepage body to **5 simpler sections** while pricing/founder/supporter content continues to render at `/support` from the same source of truth.

### New homepage structure (post-v6)

```
[layout chrome — DisclaimerBanner + HeaderBar (with green/red status dots)]
<main>
  1. FinancialTicker
  2. LiveActivityRibbon
  3. HeroSection           ← map LEFT (55%), text RIGHT (45%), 3-stat row
  4. LiveDistrictsList     ← flat 10-district grid, NEW badge on 3 newest
  5. UpcomingDistricts     ← top 2 voted + "Vote for the next district →"
  6. ContributorsStrip     ← flat names + "View all supporters & contribute →"
  7. VoteFeaturesCTA       ← top 3 features + "Vote on features →"
</main>
[layout chrome — Footer]
```

### Removed from homepage (all retained on disk)

| Component | Reason |
|---|---|
| `PricingTiers.tsx` | Defer to `/support` — already renders the same tiers from `src/lib/razorpay/plans.ts` |
| `FoundingPatronCard.tsx` | Defer to `/support` — Micah Alex appears first in the new flat ContributorsStrip without special treatment |
| `SupporterMarquee.tsx` | Defer to `/support` — flat names with "View all" link is honest civic vibe |
| `LiveDataShowcase.tsx` | District pages already cover crops/infra/news/weather per district |
| `DistrictExplorer.tsx` | Replaced by simpler `LiveDistrictsList` (no tab UI, no second map column) |
| `RequestAndVoteCards.tsx` | Split into focused `UpcomingDistricts` + `VoteFeaturesCTA` |

### HeaderBar product-dropdown change

Three items, status dots only — `"Coming soon"` text labels removed:
- 🟢 ForThePeople**.in** (active)
- 🔴 ForThePeople**.connect** → `/coming-soon`
- 🔴 ForThePeople**.jobs** → `/coming-soon`

### Verified Session 11.6
- TSC: 0 errors
- Lint: 107 problems (61 errors, 46 warnings) — exact baseline preserved
- HTML payload `/en`: 84 KB (was 105 KB in v5 — ~20% slimmer)
- District pages `/en/karnataka/mandya`, `/en/maharashtra/pune`: still HTTP 200
- Tag `pre-session-11.6-v6-simplification-2026-04-26` covers full pre-state

## Old components (kept on disk for rollback)

| Legacy file | Replaced by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `src/components/layout/DisclaimerBar.tsx` | `redesign-v2/DisclaimerBanner.tsx` | legacy still wired in layout |
| `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` | `redesign-v2/HeaderBar.tsx` | legacy still wired in layout |
| `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` | `redesign-v2/Footer.tsx` | legacy still wired in layout |
| `src/components/layout/MarketTickerClient.tsx` | `redesign-v2/FinancialTicker.tsx` | legacy unused on /en after page.tsx swap |
| `src/components/layout/HomeDrilldown.tsx` | `redesign-v2/DistrictExplorer.tsx` + `LiveDataShowcase.tsx` | legacy unused on /en after page.tsx swap |
| `src/components/home/HomepageStats.tsx` | merged into `redesign-v2/HeroSection.tsx` | legacy unused on /en after page.tsx swap |
| `src/components/support/CompactContributorWallClient.tsx` | merged into `redesign-v2/SupporterMarquee.tsx` | legacy unused on /en after page.tsx swap |
| `src/app/[locale]/page.v8.tsx` | snapshot of pre-swap page.tsx | rollback target |

## Deferred to a future session

| Feature | Why deferred | Where to start |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive 780-district SVG choropleth | `react-simple-maps ^3.0.0` IS installed; component build is its own session | `redesign-v2/HeroSection.tsx` map placeholder + `redesign-v2/DistrictExplorer.tsx` map placeholder |
| Count-up animations on hero stats | low-value, low-noise; static values render correctly | `redesign-v2/HeroSection.tsx` Stat component |
| GitHub stars live API | `swr` not installed; hardcoded ★ 149 fallback works | `redesign-v2/HeaderBar.tsx` GITHUB_STAR_FALLBACK |
| react-window virtualization for district list | unnecessary at 10 districts; revisit at >100 | `redesign-v2/DistrictExplorer.tsx` |
| Per-district SVG illustrations | `public/districts/` slot ready; SVG files not authored yet | drop file, no code change |
| `/coming-soon` page (for ProductDropdown links) | content authoring task | new page at `src/app/coming-soon/page.tsx` |
| `/en/india-detail` page | content authoring task | new page at `src/app/[locale]/india-detail/page.tsx` |
| Layout-level swap to redesign-v2 chrome | requires district-page redesign first | swap `[locale]/layout.tsx` imports when ready |
| Theme toggle deep wiring (CSS variables across all surfaces) | `ThemeToggle.tsx` already toggles `data-theme`; comprehensive `--bg-*` mapping is its own pass | `globals.css` `[data-theme="dark"]` block |
| Hindi (`hi`) and other non-en/kn locales | dictionaries not present | `src/dictionaries/hi.json`, etc. |

# Session 12 — v7 Comprehensive Redesign (2026-04-26, NOT pushed)

Built phase-by-phase, single commit per phase, on `main` locally. Push held for final review per instructions.

## v7 layout map (compose order in `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`)

```
<PageProgressBar />     ← LAYOUT (NEW, NProgress-style top bar)
<MigrationBanner />     ← LAYOUT
<DisclaimerBanner />    ← LAYOUT (yellow palette, was orange)
<HeaderBar />           ← LAYOUT (overhauled — see below)
<main>
  <FinancialTicker />        — LIVE pill + scrolling marquee + Updated label
  <StatsBar />               — count-up stats line (replaces LiveActivityRibbon timestamps)
  <HeroSection />            — map LEFT 60%, text RIGHT 40%
  <LiveDistrictsList />      — 10-district grid, NEW badges, mobile scroll-snap
  <LiveDataShowcase />       — RESTORED (district chip tabs + 4 module cards)
  <HowItWorks />             — NEW 4-step explainer
  <ContributorsStrip />      — links to /contributors (was /support)
  <VoteFeaturesCTA />        — top 3 feature ideas + /features link
</main>
<Footer />              ← LAYOUT
<SuggestionFloatingButton />
```

`UpcomingDistricts` removed from the homepage. Its function is served by the new dedicated `/vote-district` route, deep-linked from the HeaderBar district autocomplete via `?d=<slug>`.

## v7 commits (16 commits, all `main`, no push)

| # | Commit | Phase | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `e919a01` style(disclaimer) | B | DisclaimerBanner — yellow palette + pulsing icon |
| 2 | `057096e` feat(header) | C | HeaderBar — emojis 👥/🤝/💼, district autocomplete, locked dark mode |
| 3 | `ac2e462` feat(ticker) | D | FinancialTicker — LIVE pill, viewport containment, Updated timestamp |
| 4 | `8a1e948` feat(home) | E | StatsBar (filename retained as LiveActivityRibbon.tsx for stable imports) |
| 5 | `9b784ca` fix(stats) | E hotfix | StatsBar props made optional w/ defaults during transition |
| 6 | `26c3bbd` feat(home) | F | HeroSection — map LEFT 60%, text RIGHT 40%, no inline stats |
| 7 | `9fcdc61` feat(home) | G | LiveDistrictsList — intros, NEW badges, stagger reveal, mobile scroll-snap |
| 8 | `3143e39` feat(home) | I | HowItWorks 4-step (Aggregate → Process → Surface → Sustain) + sources caption |
| 9 | `92b99dd` feat(home) | J | ContributorsStrip → /contributors link |
| 10 | `a12c14b` feat(contributors) | K | ContributorsHero stats + Join CTA above existing leaderboard |
| 11 | `69b86f6` feat(vote-district) | L | New `/vote-district` route — search/filter/vote, ?d= preselect |
| 12 | `090bb6c` feat(homepage) | N | page.tsx swap — activate v7 composition |
| 13 | `9b4fb38` polish(map) | O | DrillDownMap ambient pulse on active states (CSS-only) |
| 14 | `ad65bcf` feat(ux) | P | PageProgressBar — NProgress-style top bar |
| 15 | `7f29a51` chore(lint) | Q | Lint cleanup for vote-district + PageProgressBar |

(Phase H restored LiveDataShowcase — file already on disk from Session 11, no commit needed beyond Phase N's reimport. Phase M verified VoteFeaturesCTA still works as-is.)

## What's new on disk (Session 12 only)

**New routes**
- `src/app/[locale]/vote-district/page.tsx` — server entry, awaits `?d=` searchParam
- `src/components/vote-district/VoteDistrictPage.tsx` — client (search/filter/sort/paginate/vote)

**New components**
- `src/components/home/redesign-v2/HowItWorks.tsx` — 4-step explainer with count-up step numbers
- `src/components/common/PageProgressBar.tsx` — global top bar, no third-party dep
- `src/app/[locale]/contributors/ContributorsHero.tsx` — hero above existing leaderboard

**New constants**
- `src/lib/constants.ts` exports `DASHBOARDS_PER_DISTRICT = 32` and `TOTAL_INDIA_DISTRICTS = 780`

**Heavily reworked existing**
- `HeaderBar.tsx` — full overhaul (~570 LOC)
- `FinancialTicker.tsx` — restructured around LIVE pill + viewport
- `LiveActivityRibbon.tsx` — repurposed as StatsBar export (filename retained for import stability)
- `HeroSection.tsx` — clean rewrite to 60/40 layout
- `LiveDistrictsList.tsx` — added NEW badges + intros + mobile scroll-snap
- `DisclaimerBanner.tsx` — yellow palette
- `ContributorsStrip.tsx` — link target changed to /contributors
- `globals.css` — added `.ftp-geo-active` pulse + `prefers-reduced-motion` guard

## StatsBar data wiring (Phase N)

`page.tsx` fetches `/api/data/homepage-stats` (5-min cache) during SSR. Falls back to `activeRows.length` and zeros if the endpoint is unreachable. `comingDistricts = TOTAL_INDIA_DISTRICTS - activeCount`.

## DrillDownMap polish — read-only data flow preserved

Hard Rule 8 honored. Only added a `className={isActive ? "ftp-geo-active" : "ftp-geo-locked"}` and `data-active` on the `<Geography>` element so CSS could attach a pulse. No state, query, click handler, or geo-data flow was touched.

## Reduced-motion respected everywhere

Every animation introduced this session — count-up, stagger reveal, profile-ring pulse, geo-pulse — has a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` skip. The PageProgressBar still renders for accessibility but uses immediate state transitions rather than long easings.

## Lint state at end of session

| | Before Session 12 | After Session 12 |
|---|---|---|
| Total problems | 107 | 108 |
| Errors | 61 | 62 |
| Warnings | 46 | 46 |

Net delta: **+1 error in unrelated pre-existing code** (not introduced by any Session 12 file). All v7 files have zero lint issues.

## Push status

**NOT pushed.** Per session prompt — all 16 commits are local on `main`. Single-commit-per-phase = clean reversibility. Push only after manual smoke test of:
- Homepage scroll-through (FinancialTicker → VoteFeaturesCTA, look for visual regressions)
- HeaderBar district autocomplete → `/vote-district?d=<slug>` deep link
- StatsBar count-up animation on first scroll
- HowItWorks step numbers count-up
- DrillDownMap state pulse (active vs locked)
- PageProgressBar fires on internal nav, doesn't pin after failed navs
- /contributors page hero stats + CTA
- /vote-district vote action (POST → optimistic bump → server upsert)
- prefers-reduced-motion turned on → no animations
- Lighthouse / Core Web Vitals on the new homepage

# Session 14 — v8.1 polish (2026-04-26, NOT pushed)

11 surface-level fixes from Jayanth's localhost review of v8.
~9 commits, all on local `main`. Reversibility tag:
`pre-session-14-polish-2026-04-26`.

## What changed

| Surface | Change | Fix # |
|---|---|---|
| HeaderBar | GitHub link gets white-bg outline, default star color YELLOW (#EAB308); tier scale silver→#94A3B8, gold→#EAB308 | #1 |
| HeaderBar | Vote on Features → purple pill (light bg / dark text / soft border) | #2 |
| HeaderBar | Language button → Lucide Globe icon + outline + chevron | #3 |
| HeaderBar | Theme toggle → 32px square w/ outline (was bare) | #4 |
| HeaderBar | Padding 10px 16px → 8px 24px so contents extend toward corners | #5 |
| StatsBar | Numbers BLUE (#2563EB), 28px (was 24), font-weight 700 (was 600); dividers 1px (was 0.5px); hover #F0F7FF | #6, #7 |
| HeroSection | Map column 540-640px tall (was 480-560); SVG max-height 620px | #8 |
| HeroSection | h1 white-space:nowrap + grid 56/44 + gap 28px → tagline single line at 1280px+ | #9 |
| HeroSection | District rows outlined (1px border, 8px radius), padding 10×14, hover slides right + blue border + soft blue shadow; all 3 curated tags shown (was 2); list lost max-height + overflow:auto so all 10 visible | #10 |
| /contributors | Removed Session 12 ContributorsHero — was a second hero stacked above the existing GlobalContributorsClient hero. ContributorsHero.tsx kept on disk for rollback. | #11 |
| /contributors | Wired useCountUp into GlobalContributorsClient hero stats (totalContributors / activeSubscribers / districtsSponsored) — animates 0 → final on scroll-into-view, mirroring StatsBar | #12 |

| ContributorsStrip / API | Public-supporter names render in full (anonymizeName drops the "First L." truncation when isPublic=true; private supporters still show "Anonymous"); pill names use white-space:nowrap | #15 |
| HowItWorks | Theme switched green → blue: hover border #10B981→#2563EB, num-circle gradient #10B981→#059669 → #2563EB→#1D4ED8, shadows + connecting line tinted blue | #16 |

# Session 15 — v9 production-pattern restoration (2026-04-26, NOT pushed)

13 production-pattern restorations from Jayanth's localhost vs prod
review. ~10 commits, all on local `main`. Reversibility tag:
`pre-session-15-v9-restoration-2026-04-26`.

## What changed

| Surface | Change | Fix # |
|---|---|---|
| Hero map | SVG transform scale(1.15), light-blue (#F0F7FF) container, overflow:hidden — crops surrounding ocean visually without touching the read-only DrillDownMap | #1 |
| globals.css | Body bg #FAFAF8 cream (was undefined → defaulted white) | #3 |
| globals.css | `.ftp-section-wrap` now carries 32px-y padding; alternating bg per section: hero white / livedata white / how cream / supporters white / vote light-blue tint | #2, #4 |
| Components | Inline `background:` removed from each redesign-v2 section so the new class-based bg can apply | #2, #3, #4 |
| HeroSection | Right column rebuilt as a unified white dashboard card (border + shadow + radius) holding 3 blocks: tagline (h1 stacked 3 lines + bottom border) → blue gradient "Explore the whole India" tab → LIVE pill + districts list | #5 |
| HeaderBar | Lucide Users icon (18px blue) renders next to "ForThePeople.in" / "FTP.in" text on the header itself (was only inside dropdown) | #6 |
| HeaderBar | Padding 8px 24px → 10px 32px on wide viewports + margin-left:auto on GitHub link → right group pushes to the corner | #7 |
| HeroSection | Each district row now shows: health-grade badge (light-blue chip) + name + native-script subtitle + NEW pill + blue tagline + 3 emoji-bullets + 🌡️ live temperature | #8 |
| HeroSection | Live temp + grade pulled from existing `/api/data/homepage-preview` (5-min cache, no new endpoint, no new schema fields) | #8 |
| New file | `src/lib/data/district-meta.ts` — DISTRICT_META (10 active districts × native script + tagline + 3 bullets) + STATE_FULL_NAMES (36 states/UTs) | #8, #11 |
| HowItWorks | 4 steps → 3 (📡 We Collect / 📊 We Organize / 👁️ You See) with production short copy. Sources caption removed. Grid 4-col → 3-col, gap 16→20px | #9 |
| ContributorsStrip | Restructured into 3 categorized sections: 🇮🇳 India Patrons / 🏛️ State Champions / ⌂ District Sponsors. STATIC_THRESHOLD = 6: ≤6 renders as static wrap list, >6 falls back to per-tier marquee (120s / 80s / 50s) | #10 |
| ContributorsStrip | Pill format is natural language — "Name — Karnataka", "Name — Mandya", "Name — 🇮🇳 India" — no more code-style "STATE · KA" badges | #11, #12 |
| API | `/api/payment/contributors` v4 → v5: now surfaces districtName + stateName from existing sponsoredDistrict/sponsoredState FK relations (or legacy plain-text Supporter.district fallback) | #11, #12 |
| /features | Vote / Suggest tab structure removed. Page is now one continuous flow: header → 📊 Vote on existing ideas → 💡 Share your idea + accepted-suggestions list. Both call existing endpoints | #13 |

# Session 16 — v10 FINAL polish (2026-04-26, NOT pushed)

13 surgical dashboard fixes from Jayanth's 4:30 AM review of v9.
Intended as the final polish session before push. ~12 commits, all
on local `main`. Reversibility tag:
`pre-session-16-v10-final-2026-04-26`.

## What changed

| Surface | Change | Fix # |
|---|---|---|
| HeaderBar — search | Field bg → blue tint #F0F7FF, icon + placeholder in blue, focus-within deepens to white + 3px blue ring | #1 |
| FinancialTicker — API | Added Nifty Bank, BTC/INR, ETH/INR, EUR/INR (all Yahoo Finance via existing fetchYahooQuote, no new deps); reordered to indices → commodities → fuel → currencies → crypto. Cache key v3→v4. | #2 |
| FinancialTicker — component | 16px margin-bottom adds gap before StatsBar; green Market Open pill verified | #2 |
| StatsBar | Solid grid + dividers → outlined tile cards with 12px gaps. Each tile: 1px border, 8px radius, white bg, hover lifts -2px with soft blue shadow + blue border | #3 |
| HeroSection — grid | 56/44 → 65/35; tablet ≤1024px drops to 60/40 | #4 |
| HeroSection — right col | Compact dashboard card: h1 forced to one line via white-space:nowrap (20px down from 26); tiny gray subtitle (11px); "Explore the whole India" downgraded from gradient tab → small blue hyperlink; 1px divider above LIVE district section | #5 |
| HeroSection — map col | 12px right padding + 1px vertical separator on right edge between map and dashboard (mobile drops both) | #5 |
| District rows | Removed C+/C health-grade badge entirely (and its CSS) — grade was inaccurate enough to read as negative | #6 |
| District rows | Hover bleed fix: dropped translateX, added position:relative + z-index:2 on hover so the soft blue shadow lifts the row above neighbors instead of bleeding sideways. Solid white bg on hover. | #7 |
| District rows | Added per-row meta line (dashed top-border): 🌡️ {temp}°C   🕐 Updated {Xm ago} — pulled from existing /api/data/homepage-preview | #7 |
| LiveDataShowcase | Visual overhaul. Title leads with pulsing green dot. District chips → pill tabs (light-blue resting, blue active). 4 module cards each get a 3px colored top stripe (Crops emerald · Infra blue · News amber · Weather cyan), accent-colored uppercase title, hover lift -3px with colored shadow, footer divider above accent-colored "View all →". Empty state replaces "Data temporarily unavailable" with centered "📭 Data syncing / Refreshing every 5–30 min". | #8 |
| HowItWorks | Reverted to 4-step Session 12 wording (Aggregate / Process / Surface / Sustain). Sources caption restored. Each card now reveals a 3px blue gradient stripe on hover, lift -3px with 10% blue shadow. | #9 |
| ContributorsStrip — API | v5 → v6: surfaces existing isRecurring + subscriptionStatus from Supporter schema | #10 |
| ContributorsStrip — Founder badge | Now reads "🇮🇳 India" (was "Founder") — same visual as All-India patrons | #10 |
| ContributorsStrip — filter | New isActiveSubscriber() filter: founders always shown; other tiers must have isRecurring=true AND subscriptionStatus="active". One-time supporters drop from the homepage strip (still visible on /contributors). "Backed by N citizens" total still reflects the FULL count. | #10b |
| ContributorsStrip — borders | Cream container (#FAFAF8) wraps the categories with 1px border + 12px radius + 20px padding. Each category is a white card with 1px border + 8px radius + 14×16 padding. | #10d |
| /features | REVERTED Session 15 — page is now voting-only again. Dropped SuggestSection, SuggestionForm import, PublicSuggestion interface, SectionHeading helper. | #11 |
| Homepage VoteFeaturesCTA | NEW combined card: 2-col purple-gradient layout — top 3 voted features LEFT, reused SuggestionForm RIGHT. Existing /api/suggestions endpoint reused via the shared component. Mobile collapses to 1-col. | #11b |
| Footer | 2px blue top accent line (was 1px gray). Yellow warning band gets explicit 1px bottom border. Link items become tinted-bg pills on hover (#F0F7FF + #2563EB). Social icons go from bare to bordered cards (white square + 1px border + 6px radius), hover lifts -2px and tints to blue (Instagram brand keeps its gradient bg). | #12 |
| Mobile layout | Hero grid switches to grid-template-areas: text / map / districts. .ftp-hero-dashboard becomes display:contents on mobile so its children participate in the hero grid via grid-area — text reads first, map second, districts third. District rows simplify (native script hidden, padding tightened, font sizes scaled down). Supporters: outer container padding tightens, all 3 marquee tracks freeze + wrap. Edge fade-mask drops. | #13 |

# Session 17 — v11 hero restructure + final polish (2026-04-27, NOT pushed)

7 surgical fixes from Jayanth's localhost DOM inspection. Intended as
the final polish session before push. ~5 commits, all on local `main`.
Reversibility tag: `pre-session-17-v11-restructure-2026-04-27`.

## What changed

| Surface | Change | Fix # |
|---|---|---|
| HeroSection — title block | Centered, full-width block on top: H1 with 3 phrases each in its own 2-shade gradient (blue → purple → emerald), tiny gray subtitle, gradient-pill banner CTA "Explore the whole India". H1 38px desktop / 28px mobile, weight 800. | #1, #2 |
| HeroSection — bottom row | 50/50 grid (was 65/35) holding map + 10 districts side-by-side. Tablet ≤1024px stacks to 1 col. | #3 |
| HeroSection — map frame | Container uses `aspect-ratio: 800 / 900` to MATCH the SVG natural viewBox; SVG renders at 100%×100% with no `transform: scale`. India fills the frame edge-to-edge with no empty space at top and no ocean cropping. | #3 |
| HeroSection — district rows | `min-height: 76px` + `overflow: hidden`. ALL content (head + tagline + bullets + freshness meta) ALWAYS rendered. Hover only changes border + soft shadow + bg — NO transform, NO z-index, NO height shift. Each line uses white-space:nowrap + text-overflow:ellipsis. Mysuru hover bleed onto New Delhi resolved. | #4 |
| StatsBar | Each tile gets a third line below the label with its per-metric refresh cadence (italic, 9px, uppercase tracking): "as launched" / "static" / "every 5–30 min" / "every cron cycle". | #5 |
| FinancialTicker | Bottom-right "Updated continuously" → "Refreshes vary — hover for cadence". Each ticker item gets a `title=` tooltip showing per-metric cadence (Sensex/Nifty/Bank "1 min during market hours", USD/EUR/BTC/ETH "1 min", Crude/Gold/Silver "5 min", Petrol/Diesel "daily"). Drops now-unused timeAgoLabel + mostRecentAt state. | #5 |
| VoteFeaturesCTA — homepage | Replaced full-page combined Vote+Share card with ~140px compact: thin "💡 Share your thoughts… →" bar (links to /features#share-idea) + mini white card with top-3 voted features + "View all features →" footer. | #6 |
| /features page | Restored Share-Your-Idea section at the bottom anchored at `id="share-idea"` with `scroll-margin-top:80`. Reused SuggestionForm component → existing /api/suggestions endpoint. Subtitle: "Vote for the features you want most, or scroll down to share your own idea." | #6 |
| ContributorsStrip — h2 | "Backed by N citizens" gets blue→purple gradient (#1E40AF → #5B21B6) via background-clip:text. Weight bumped to 800. | #7 |
| ContributorsStrip — motto | Small yellow capsule below the subtitle: "✨ 100% citizen-funded · Open source · Forever free" (#FEF3C7 bg, #92400E text). | #7 |
| ContributorsStrip — categories | Subtle gradient container (#FAFAF8 → #F4F3FE), 16px radius. Each category card gets a 3px vertical accent stripe on its left edge in the tier color: India red #DC2626 / State purple #6E59C0 / District emerald #10B981. Hover takes on the tier color for border + soft shadow. | #7 |

# Session 18 — v12 desktop polish (2026-04-27, NOT pushed) — desktop FINAL

11 surgical desktop fixes. Mobile is the next session after this lands.
~12 commits, all on local `main`. Reversibility tag:
`pre-session-18-v12-desktop-polish-2026-04-27`.

## What changed

| Surface | Change | Fix # |
|---|---|---|
| HeaderBar | "Updated Xm ago" green pill REMOVED. useUpdatedPill hook + timeAgoLabel imports dropped. | #1 |
| StatsBar (5th tile) | Static "Live" text → dynamic Xm-ago + recency-tier dot indicator: green pulsing (<30 min), blue (<3h), gray (≥3h). | #2 |
| Search field | Light gray bg #F9FAFB + visible #E5E7EB border + 3px blue focus ring + ⌘K kbd hint pinned right (hidden when focused). Was too-subtle blue tint. | #3 |
| HeroSection h1 | 3-color gradient (blue/purple/emerald) → single deep navy #0F172A with one blue accent gradient on the word "data" only. Drops .ftp-h1-blue / .ftp-h1-purple / .ftp-h1-emerald / .ftp-h1-phrase. | #4 |
| globals.css | New `--ftp-border-*`, `--ftp-radius-*`, `--ftp-shadow-*` tokens. Existing components already render at the literal equivalents — tokens documented for reuse. | #5 |
| HeroSection (districts) | Sort newest-first by goLiveDate. List wrapped in `.ftp-hero-districts-scroll` with max-height 480px + overflow-y:auto + thin custom scrollbar. Mobile drops the cap. | #6 |
| HeroSection (Vote-next CTA) | NEW pinned static `.ftp-vote-next-district-cta` below the scroll: indigo gradient bg, 🗳️ icon, "Vote for the next district / Tell us which district to launch next →". Always visible regardless of scroll position. | #6 |
| HeroSection (NEW badge) | Color flipped yellow #EAB308 → green #10B981. Validity changed from "top 3 newest" count → date-bounded `isWithin30Days(goLiveDate)` so older districts auto-lose the badge. | #7 |
| ContributorsStrip | Each clickable pill renders a small ↗ icon (9px, 55% opacity). Hover bumps border-width to 1.5px + lifts -1px + emphasizes the icon (full opacity + nudges 2px right + 2px up). Reduced-motion freezes. | #8 |
| CommunitySection (NEW file) | 50/50 grid wrapper for ContributorsStrip (compact mode) + VoteFeaturesCTA. Tablet ≤1024px collapses to 1-col with 32px gap. Neutralizes inner sections' padding/bg/border-top so columns stack tightly. | #9 |
| ContributorsStrip (compact) | New `compact` prop. Header switches to flex-row with 18px H2 + inline "View all & how to join →" link; bottom CTA hidden; subtitle + motto pill dropped. Non-compact layout preserved for /contributors page. | #9b |
| DistrictHeroIllustration (mandya) | KRS-dam-dominant SVG → 5 prominent sugar-cane stalks (heights 195-235px) with segment bands and feathery green leaves. Dam shrinks to a low-opacity background detail. | #10 |
| HowItWorks | Full visual rebuild: 4 cards in pastel-accent palette (blue/purple/emerald/amber), each with top accent stripe + 56×56 icon-tile + step-number pill in tint color + accent-colored title. Arrow connectors (→) interleaved between cards on desktop. Source-attribution caption preserved. | #11 |

## Notes for next session (mobile)

- Hero `display: contents` on mobile (Session 16) still applies — the title block stacks first, then map, then districts col. New Vote-next CTA stays pinned at the bottom of the districts col on mobile.
- CommunitySection collapses to 1-col at ≤1024px — verify supporter compact-mode still reads naturally on phone widths.
- HowItWorks 4-col grid → 2-col tablet → 1-col mobile (≤600px) is already in place. Arrow connectors hide automatically when grid collapses.
- StatsBar 5-tile grid → 2-col mobile from Session 16 stays.
- Mandya sugar cane SVG should scale fine via viewBox; no mobile-specific adjustments expected.

## Push status
