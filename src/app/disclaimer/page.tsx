        <h2 style={h2Style}>1. Independent Platform</h2>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          ForThePeople.in is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit citizen initiative built by Jayanth M B. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, funded by, or part of any government body, political party, political organisation, or commercial entity. No government official or party has editorial control over this platform.

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={h2Style}>2. Political Neutrality</h2>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          ForThePeople.in is a connecting tool between citizens and governance — not an opposition platform and not a government mouthpiece. We present publicly available government data as it is published, without commentary, endorsement, or criticism of any political party, politician, or government. Where news headlines or AI-generated summaries appear, they are aggregated from third-party sources and reflect those sources&apos; framing, not ours. Citizens are free to form their own opinions based on the data presented.

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={h2Style}>3. Not an Official Government Website</h2>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          ForThePeople.in is NOT an official government website. We do not have authority to issue government documents, register complaints on behalf of government departments, or confirm the validity of any government decision. For official records, benefits, and filings, always visit the original government portal.

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={h2Style}>4. Government Emblems, Logos, and Trademarks</h2>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          We do not use, reproduce, or imitate any government emblem, seal, coat of arms, or official logo — including but not limited to the State Emblem of India, state seals, ministry logos, or police/court insignia. References to government departments, officials, or schemes by name are made for factual and informational purposes only, in the public interest, and do not constitute any claim of affiliation, endorsement, or authority under the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950.

Historical data is presented as published by the originating government body and has not been independently audited by us.
