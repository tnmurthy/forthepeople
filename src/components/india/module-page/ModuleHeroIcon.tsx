 * Per-module Lucide icon used in the hero tile when no heroImage is set.
 * Replaces the Phase 2.5d hand-drawn SVG library — those tigers looked
 * like cartoon dogs and the fisheries SVG was the same shape recoloured
 * green. The fix is to stop trying.
 *
 * To upgrade a module to a real photograph, set heroImage on the
 * IndiaModuleDef registry entry — ModuleHero.tsx prefers heroImage when
 * set and ignores this icon.
