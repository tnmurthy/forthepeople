/**
 * ForThePeople.in — Manual-research data fill for Mysuru infrastructure
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/fill-mysuru-infra.ts [--dry-run]
 *
 * Same semantics as fill-mandya-infra.ts:
 *   - Fuzzy match against existing rows by name (primary + alternates)
 *   - UPDATE only null fields, never overwrite concrete data
 *   - Mirror originalBudget → revisedBudget → budget when those are null
 *   - Category override only when current is null / empty / "General"
 *   - Status upgrade only forward in the lifecycle
 *   - One InfraUpdate per fill with updateType="MANUAL_RESEARCH"
 *
 * Zero AI calls.
