/**
 * Pune schools seed — 3 aggregate admin-body rows + 5 notable institutions.
 *
 * ForThePeople.in — independent citizen platform by Jayanth M B.
 *
 * SCOPE: Pune has 3,546+ ZP primary schools alone plus thousands more
 * under PMC and private/aided. Individual-school seeding at scale is out
 * of scope for this prompt. This seed captures (a) administrative-body
 * aggregates so a user sees "the district runs ~this much education"
 * at a glance, and (b) 5 flagship higher-ed institutions that users
 * expect to see listed.
 *
 * SCHEMA GAPS FLAGGED:
 *   - No description/source/sourceSecondary/disclaimer columns on School.
 *   - No `administrativeBody` column.
 *   - No `schoolCount` column for aggregate rows — using `students` /
 *     `teachers` (populated only for aggregates) and storing ancillary
 *     prose in `address`.
 *   These are packed into `address` (free-text) to keep data honest while
 *   avoiding a schema migration.
 *
 * TYPE / LEVEL values: free-text in schema (Mumbai uses mixed-case:
 * "PRIVATE", "GOVERNMENT", "AIDED", "Kendriya Vidyalaya", "University",
 * levels "Primary"/"Secondary"/"Senior Secondary"/"College"/"University").
 * This seed introduces `type: "AGGREGATE"` for the 3 admin-body rows and
 * uses existing Mumbai conventions for the 5 institutions.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, name}) → skip-if-exists.
