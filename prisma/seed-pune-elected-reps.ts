/**
 * Pune elected representatives + governance addendum seed (Prompt 4/6).
 *
 * ForThePeople.in — independent citizen platform by Jayanth M B.
 *
 * SCOPE — 25 records:
 *   • 21 MLAs covering the 21 Vidhan Sabha seats in Pune district
 *     (1 row is SEAT VACANT placeholder for Baramati pending the April 23,
 *     2026 by-election result certification by ECI).
 *   • 3 Lok Sabha MPs whose constituencies contain Pune VS seats
 *     (Supriya Sule / Baramati, Dr. Amol Kolhe / Shirur, Shrirang Barne / Maval).
 *     The 4th MP — Murlidhar Mohol / Pune LS — is already seeded from
 *     Prompt 2/6 (seed-pune-leaders.ts). Not duplicated here.
 *   • 1 governance addendum — Ravi Landge, PCMC Mayor. Same record also
 *     exists in seed-pune-leaders.ts; idempotency guard prevents duplicate.
 *
 * TIER CONVENTION (per Prompt 2 calibration + Mumbai seed-file intent):
 *   tier 1 = Lok Sabha MP
 *   tier 2 = MLA
 *   tier 3 = Municipal Corp (Mayor / Commissioner) — Landge addendum here
 *
 * ROLE STRINGS:
 *   - MPs: "Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha)" (matches existing Mohol
 *     record + Mumbai seed file convention; prompt spec's comma form
 *     "Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha" harmonized to parens form for
 *     cross-record consistency).
 *   - MLAs: "Member of Legislative Assembly" (per prompt spec).
 *   - Vacant seat: "Member of Legislative Assembly (Seat Vacant)".
 *
 * BARAMATI SEAT HANDLING (CRITICAL):
 *   Ajit Pawar died 2026-01-28. By-election VOTING April 23, 2026 —
 *   result not yet certified by ECI at time of this seed being written.
 *   Sunetra Ajit Pawar is the principal candidate (MVA did not field
 *   against her, Congress withdrew Aakash More) but that is NOT the
 *   same as "won". Data integrity rule: seed the seat as VACANT, not
 *   as Sunetra's. Once ECI certifies the result, update in a follow-up
 *   seed — the idempotency guard will skip the vacant row if the new
 *   record has a different `name`, so you'd either update the vacant
 *   row's name/party in a patch script, or add a new row (and set the
 *   vacant one's active=false).
 *
 * PARTY FORMAT:
 *   Short forms per prompt spec (BJP, INC, NCP, NCP-SP, SHS, SHS-UBT,
 *   IND, RPI (A), etc.). Note: Mumbai's existing rows use "Shiv Sena (UBT)"
 *   / "Shiv Sena (Shinde)" format. This seed follows prompt's shorter
 *   forms ("SHS-UBT" / "SHS") — flagged for cross-district party-format
 *   reconciliation in a later pass.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, name, role}) → skip-if-exists.
 * Landge record overlaps with seed-pune-leaders.ts: safe, skip triggers
 * on whichever seed runs second.
