/**
 * Pune budgets seed — 5 verified records (Prompt 3/6, Seed B — money).
 *
 * ForThePeople.in — independent citizen platform by Jayanth M B.
 *
 * MODEL: BudgetAllocation (richer than BudgetEntry — has remarks/sourceUrl/
 * department/lapsed/quarter). Mumbai currently uses BudgetEntry (10 rows,
 * sector-based). This seed diverges because Mumbai's pattern (sector
 * line-items) doesn't fit the prompt's "body-level annual budget"
 * records with presenter / approval / highlights / disclaimer. The richer
 * schema fits cleanly. Flagged for reconciliation.
 *
 * FIELD MAPPING (prompt → schema):
 *   budgetBody        → department      (e.g., "Pune Municipal Corporation")
 *   fiscalYear        → fiscalYear
 *   amount            → allocated
 *   status            → category        ("Annual Budget (Previous Year)" /
 *                                        "Annual Budget (Current Year)")
 *   presentedBy/On    → packed into remarks
 *   highlights/desc   → packed into remarks
 *   sourceSecondary   → packed into remarks (schema has only 1 sourceUrl)
 *   disclaimer        → packed into remarks
 *
 * All amounts in RUPEES (not crore). All 5 records have primary source +
 * sourceUrl + packed secondary + disclaimer in remarks.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, fiscalYear, department, category})
 * → skip-if-exists because BudgetAllocation has no unique constraint.
