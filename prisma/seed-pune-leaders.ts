/**
 * Pune leadership seed — 17 verified officials (Prompt 2/6, Seed A).
 *
 * ForThePeople.in — independent citizen transparency platform by Jayanth M B.
 *
 * SCOPE:
 *   District-level governance (no MLAs, no Rajya Sabha, no Baramati/Maval/
 *   Shirur MPs — those come in Prompt 4 Elections). Leaders grouped by the
 *   codebase's existing tier convention (see prisma/seed-mumbai-data.ts):
 *     Tier 1 — Lok Sabha MP
 *     Tier 3 — Municipal Corporation (Mayor + Commissioner, PMC and PCMC)
 *     Tier 4 — Administration + state-level political (Collector, Div Comm,
 *              ZP CEO, Guardian Minister/DCM)
 *     Tier 5 — Police commissionerates + Rural SP
 *     Tier 6 — Judiciary
 *   Total: 1 + 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 17.
 *
 * CALIBRATION NOTES (from Prompt 2 decision block):
 *   - No `category` column — using integer `tier`.
 *   - No `sourceUrl` column — `source` holds "Publication | URL" (pipe-delimited).
 *   - Extra facts (cadre, batch, predecessor, portfolios, appointment context)
 *     are packed into `roleDescription`. Free-text `since` stores appointment
 *     year where known.
 *   - No fabricated data: `phone`, `email`, `photoUrl`, `photoLicense`,
 *     `nameLocal`, `roleLocal`, `talukId` are null for every record.
 *   - `active` defaults to true (not set explicitly).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, name, role}) → skip-if-exists
 * because Leader has no natural unique constraint.
 *
 * Data verified as of April 2026. `lastVerifiedAt` set to seed execution time.
