/**
 * Pune FamousPersonality — 6 verified historical figures connected to Pune.
 *
 * Categories used (Title Case, matching Mumbai convention):
 *   - "Freedom Fighter" (existing): Tilak, Gokhale, Savarkar
 *   - "Social Reformer" (new): Jyotirao Phule (only personality bornInDistrict=true)
 *   - "Educator" (new): Savitribai Phule, Karve
 *
 * Both new categories scalable + accurate — Mumbai's nearest existing label
 * ("Freedom Fighter" for Ambedkar) doesn't fit these figures' primary historical
 * contributions. Title Case matches Mumbai pattern.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, name}).
