/**
 * Delhi district Census 2011 baseline — all 11 districts.
 *
 * SOURCE:
 *   Census of India 2011, Primary Census Abstract (PCA), NCT of Delhi.
 *   Official: https://censusindia.gov.in (Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India)
 *   Delhi DES mirror: https://des.delhi.gov.in/des/population-census-2011
 *   District-level verified against Wikipedia district articles and
 *   censusindia.co.in aggregated pages (which source to Census PCA).
 *
 * SCOPE:
 *   Census 2011 district-level baseline for all 11 current Delhi districts.
 *   Fields seeded (where verified): totalPopulation, malePopulation,
 *   femalePopulation, sexRatio, childSexRatio, literacyTotal, literacyMale,
 *   literacyFemale, urbanPct, areaSqKm, density, scPct, stPct.
 *
 *   Religion and caste (beyond SC/ST) NOT seeded per-district — Census 2011
 *   Table C-01 district data was not retrieved this session. State-level
 *   religion available in Delhi state profile row; per-district deferred
 *   to Phase 2 (would require downloading Table C-01 from NADA catalog).
 *
 * POST-2011 DISTRICTS (created 2012):
 *   Shahdara: carved from parts of North East Delhi + East Delhi
 *   South East Delhi: carved from parts of South Delhi + New Delhi
 *   Both get DemographicProfile rows with dataset="Census 2011 Pre-Bifurcation"
 *   and explanatory notes — same honesty pattern as tracking rows.
 *
 * SUM-CHECK VERIFIED:
 *   Sum of 9 district populations = 16,787,941 = Delhi state total exactly.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT.
