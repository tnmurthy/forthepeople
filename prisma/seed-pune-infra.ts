/**
 * Pune infrastructure seed — 13 verified projects (Prompt 3/6, Seed B).
 *
 * ForThePeople.in — independent citizen platform by Jayanth M B.
 *
 * SCOPE: 13 projects covering Metro, Road, Water, Airport. Project 14
 * (Pune-Nashik Semi-High Speed Rail) is DEFERRED per prompt's "skip if
 * unverifiable" directive — has on-off history, no recent 2026-confirmed
 * status in the sources reviewed. Better to ship 13 verified than 14
 * with one uncertain.
 *
 * FIELD MAPPING (prompt → schema):
 *   name, description            → name, description
 *   sector                       → category (schema uses "category"; values
 *                                  aligned with existing Mumbai infra rows:
 *                                  METRO / ROAD / WATER / AIRPORT / RAIL)
 *   approvedCost / budget        → budget (rupees)
 *   status (free-text)           → status (schema is free-text String)
 *   executingAgency              → executingAgency
 *   foundationLaidOn / ...Date   → startDate (primary), actualStartDate,
 *                                  completionDate (mapped per project)
 *   targetCompletionDate         → expectedEnd / revisedEndDate
 *   completionPercent            → progressPct
 *   length / stationCount / etc  → packed into description (no schema col)
 *
 * EXTRA LEGAL-HYGIENE FIELDS (not in schema — packed into sourceUrls Json):
 *   sourceSecondary              → sourceUrls.secondary { publication, url }
 *   disclaimer                   → sourceUrls.disclaimer (string)
 *   subJudice                    → sourceUrls.subJudice (boolean)
 *   hasPublicOpposition          → sourceUrls.hasPublicOpposition (boolean)
 *   environmentalClearanceStatus → sourceUrls.environmentalClearance (string)
 *
 * All amounts in RUPEES. Status values use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE consistent
 * with Mumbai's newer rows (e.g., UNDER_CONSTRUCTION, OPERATIONAL).
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, name}) → skip-if-exists.
