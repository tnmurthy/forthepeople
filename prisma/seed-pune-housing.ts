/**
 * Pune HousingScheme — single PMAY-U FY 2026-27 row.
 *
 * ForThePeople.in — independent citizen platform by Jayanth M B.
 *
 * BACKGROUND: /en/maharashtra/pune/housing rendered blank pre-fix because
 * HousingScheme had 0 rows for Pune. The /housing UI reads from
 * HousingScheme (not the Scheme model where Prompt 5 routed PMAY entries).
 * Mandya has 2 rows driving its full charts + AI analysis.
 *
 * SCOPE: ONE verified row only — PMAY-U FY 2026-27. PMAY-G DEFERRED to
 * post-launch because Pune district-level rural-housing disaggregation
 * is not publicly available in this audit window. Pune ZP runs real Maha
 * Awas Abhiyan with real beneficiaries; seeding zeros would misrepresent.
 * Better one honest row than two with one fabricated.
 *
 * SCHEMA NOTE: HousingScheme.targetHouses, sanctioned, completed,
 * inProgress are REQUIRED non-nullable Int. sanctioned/completed/
 * inProgress = 0 because FY 2026-27 just started April 1 — these
 * are accurate values, not placeholders.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Uses findFirst({districtId, schemeName, fiscalYear}).
 *
 * Refs: Forthepeople/26-Pune-Pre-Push-Fix-2026-04-24.md
 *       (post-launch follow-up section: PMAY-G retroactive seed needed
 *       once rural disaggregation surfaces from pmayg.nic.in / ZP /
 *       Divisional Commissioner / RTI route)
